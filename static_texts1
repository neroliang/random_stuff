      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The 1870s and 1880s saw a flurry of newspaper publishing in Ashburton. First there was the Ashburton Mail, established in 1877 by Joseph Ivess, a prolific publisher of country newspapers. This was followed by the Evening Echo in 1878. The next year Ivess published the Evening News to help him in his bid for the Ashburton mayoralty. Charles Dixon and Horace Weeks, the owners of the Echo, now called the Ashburton Herald, started the Ashburton Guardian to oppose Ivess’s ambitions. Ivess narrowly lost the election although it’s not clear what, if any, effect the Guardian had on this.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

Nō te tau o muri mai, ka tāngia e Ivess te Evening News hei āwhina i tāna whai i te tūranga o te Mea o Ashburton. Nā Charles Dixon rāua ko Horace Weeks, ngā rangatira o te Echo, ko tōna ingoa hōu ko te Ashburton Herald, ka tāngia ai te Ashburton Guardian hei tohe i ngā wawata a Ivess. Ka hinga kau a Ivess, ēngari kāore i te mārama he aha te pānga mai o te Guardian ki taua hinganga nei.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

Charles Dixon and Horace Weeks, the owners of the Echo, now called the Ashburton Herald, started the Ashburton Guardian to oppose Ivess’s ambitions. Ivess narrowly lost the election although it’s not clear what, if any, effect the Guardian had on this. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The town couldn’t support four newspapers so in 1880 Edward George Wright and Hugo Friedlander, the new owners of the Herald and Guardian, merged their two papers under the title of the Ashburton Guardian. In 1884 the Mail was sold to William Jules Steward. Steward had worked on various papers in Canterbury and Otago and represented the area in local and national politics. In 1885 Steward acquired the Guardian as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Steward’s political commitments (he was a Member of the House of Representatives from 1881 to 1911), made it difficult for him to devote enough time to his papers and in the 1890s he leased them to Henry Willis, eventually selling them to Robert Bell in 1900. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Robert Bell had worked on newspapers in Australia and Timaru before coming to Ashburton. He would become Managing Director of the Lyttelton Times in 1917 and Chairman of the Timaru Post in 1922. Bell closed the Mail in 1932 and died in 1937. His son W.B. Bell succeeded him as manager. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Guardian is still published by the Bell family, making it one of the few independently-owned daily newspapers left in New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Nō te 1844 ka hokona ai te Mail ki a William Jules Steward. Ko tā Steward he mahi ki ētahi tūmomo nūpepa i Waitaha me Otākou, ko ia hoki te māngai o taua takiwā ki te kāwanatanga ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki. Nō te 1885, ka riro i a Steward te Guardian rā anō hoki. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nā ngā herenga tōrangapū a Steward (he Mema Paremata ia mai i te 1881 ki te 1911), ka uaua kē te whai taima mō āna nūpepa, nō ngā 1890 ka rīhingia ki a Henry Willis, te mutunga iho, ka hokona atu ki a Robert Bell i te tau 1900. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko tā Robert Bell he mahi nūpepa ki Ahitereiria me Timaru nō mua noa o tana taenga ki Ashburton. Ko ia te Kaiwhakahaere Matua o te Lyttelton Times i te 1917, te Hiamana hoki o te Timaru Post i te 1922. Ka katia e Bell te Mail i te 1932, ka mate i te 1937. Nō muri mai i a ia ko tāna tama ko W.B. Bell te kaiwhakahaere. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kei te tāngia tonungia te Guardian e te whānau Bell, ko ia tētahi o ngā nūpepa ruarua noa o Aotearoa, ngā mea whai rangatira motuhake. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The first few years of the Herald have unfortunately not survived and the exact date of the first issue is unclear. It was probably published in the latter part of May 1896, as the Tuapeka Times from nearby Lawrence reported on 30 May 1896 that it had received the first issue of the Herald, which it described as being ‘creditably brought out’.

The Herald was established by Henry Symes, the Town Clerk and later Mayor of Alexandra, with plant that had been used to produce the Teviot Herald and Roxburgh District Gazette. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; J D Buchanan became editor of the Herald in 1898 and in the following year he took over ownership of the paper. Buchanan had previously been involved with the Mount Ida Chronicle and the Dunstan Times and after his arrival at the Alexandra Herald the Otago Witness noted it was now ‘a smartly got-up paper of eight pages, and claims to contain more columns of interesting reading matter than any other newspaper upon the goldfields’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the 1890s and the early years of the twentieth century Alexandra developed rapidly, based on dredging for gold in nearby rivers. Under Buchanan and later, T H Cahill, the Herald shared in the increasing prosperity of the district. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1939 the Herald was purchased by Harold Stevens, owner of the rival Dunstan Times which was published in Clyde. The Herald was merged with the Dunstan Times and the Queenstown-based Lake County Mail to form the Central Otago News in 1948, a bi-weekly publication which circulated widely throughout Central Otago. The Stevens family continued to have a close association with the newspaper for many years, in particular Geoff Stevens as managing director and Syd Stevens as editor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As of 2015, the News is still being published. It is part of the Allied Press group, publisher of the Otago Daily Times, and is circulated weekly to over 21,500 homes in the Central Otago area. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Ka haumitia te Herald ki roto i te Dunstan Times me te Lake County Mail i Whakatipu, ka noho ai ko te Central Otago News i te tau 1948.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives&lt;/i&gt; (AJHR), sometimes known as &amp;quot;the A to Js&amp;quot;, is a collection of government-related reports published every year from 1858. The reports cover many subjects, documenting the work of government departments and a wide range of other activities carried out by, or of interest to, the government of the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AJHR is one of the most valuable tools for understanding how New Zealand has developed from its earliest colonial beginnings to the present. It provides a wealth of information for researchers working across many fields.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why is the AJHR published?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, the AJHR is published because Parliament decides to publish them. Many official reports and papers are presented to the House of Representatives by ministers and government departments every year. These documents relate to many subjects, and are essential to Parliament&amp;#39;s ability to make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Papers tabled in the House are listed in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the House of Representatives&lt;/i&gt; (not included on this website), a publication which logs Parliament&amp;#39;s daily business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All papers tabled before Parliament are&amp;nbsp;considered appendices to the &lt;i&gt;Journal&lt;/i&gt;. The House&amp;nbsp;orders some of these&amp;nbsp;papers&amp;nbsp;to be printed, and these are published annually in a separate series of volumes as the &lt;i&gt;Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Legislative Council (or Upper House of Parliament) also published a separate volume of papers, the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the Legislative Council&lt;/i&gt; (not included on this website), before it was abolished in 1951. The Council&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Journal&lt;/i&gt; includes appendices at the end of some volumes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How does the AJHR work?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AJHR is arranged into broad themes. The following list provides a broad outline of the themes since the late nineteenth century:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt; &lt;li&gt;A: legislative, political, and foreign affairs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;B: public finance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;C: Crown lands, mines, forests, primary production, environment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;D: immigration, public works, energy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;E: education, welfare, and justice&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;F: post office, broadcasting, communications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;G: Maori affairs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;H: miscellaneous, commissions of inquiry&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I: reports of select committees&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;J: petitions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each theme includes a series of reports grouped by &amp;quot;shoulder number&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; a letter of the alphabet followed by a number. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;General report on lunatic asylums in New Zealand (by Dr. Paley)&amp;quot;, AJHR, 1874, H-1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This indicates that the report was published in 1874 and was the first document in the &amp;quot;H&amp;quot; theme that year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s in the AJHR?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annual reports of government departments&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most government departments published annual reports in the AJHR from the 1870s-80s onwards. These reports cover the department&amp;#39;s activities over the year in question, tracing developments and changes of policy and sometimes personnel, and are a valuable source of information. They often contain tables of statistics, maps, and illustrations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reports of commissions of inquiry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Governments have regularly held commissions of inquiry to address a variety of issues since the nineteenth century. The reports of most of these inquiries were published in the AJHR, sometimes along with the commission&amp;#39;s minutes and the testimony of witnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Stout-Ngata Commission into Maori land tenure in 1907, and the Mazengarb report on &amp;quot;Moral Delinquency in children and adolescents&amp;quot; in 1954, are well-known examples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reports relating to broader government work&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AJHR includes other reports relating to a variety of subjects. Sometimes members of Parliament requested a report on certain areas of government activity, and these were prepared by the relevant department. Other times departments produced reports on the results of particular Acts, or research into proposed changes and innovations. The &amp;quot;Miscellaneous&amp;quot; (H) section published at the end of each year&amp;#39;s AJHR is always a rich trove of interesting and unusual material.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Images and maps&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the reports contain&amp;nbsp;maps, plans, photos, sketches, and diagrams. These illuminate many aspects of New Zealand life, from sketch maps of planned railway lines to photographs of living conditions in early-twentieth century housing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What can I use the AJHR for?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AJHR can be used for a wide variety of research purposes in addition to the study of government-related history. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Family history/whakapapa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt; &lt;li&gt;reports on immigrant ships&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;lists of sheep-owners&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;lists of government employees&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;buying and selling land&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;petitions to government&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;witnesses to inquiries&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;returns of drownings&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Local history&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt; &lt;li&gt;sales and purchases of land and patterns of settlement&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;development of transport into the area&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;development of educational facilities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;results of local elections&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;details of community activities such as wine-growing and gum-digging&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maori history&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt; &lt;li&gt;reports from native districts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;records of land purchasing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Maori Department, Native Trustee annual reports&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;commissions of inquiry into Maori issues&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;petitions to government from Maori&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;correspondence and other documents written in Te Reo Maori&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Transport&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt; &lt;li&gt;railways&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;air services&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;harbours&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;roads&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Transport Department&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Military&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt; &lt;li&gt;troops serving in the Boer war (1899-1902)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;financing and planning of World War one (1914-18)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;annual reports of the Army, Air Force, and Navy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;reports on the territorial force&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;International relations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt; &lt;li&gt;New Zealand governor and relations with Britain&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;records of New Zealand involvement in international forums such as the League of Nations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;annual reports of New Zealand territories in the Pacific&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;reports on trade agreements and other diplomatic activities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Agriculture, science, and industry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt; &lt;li&gt;reports of scientific expeditions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;reports addressing pest control and environmental change&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;reports of the DSIR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;annual reports of the Agriculture Department (later MAF)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;reports on land development and finance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Social history&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt; &lt;li&gt;crime and punishment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;social security&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;mental health&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Further information&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AJHRs were split into two sequences of published volumes in 1999. The first sequence, the &lt;i&gt;New Zealand Parliamentary Papers&lt;/i&gt;, included most government reports. The second, still called the &lt;i&gt;Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives&lt;/i&gt;, contains select committee reports and other papers relating to the operation of Parliament. Many post-1999 reports are available online at &lt;a href="http://www.parliament.nz"&gt;www.parliament.nz&lt;/a&gt; and the websites of the government agencies which created them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some papers presented to the House are not published as part of the AJHR, and remain unpublished. Many such papers are held by Archives New Zealand Head Office in Wellington, the Parliamentary Library, or the government departments which created them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Copyright and reproduction statement&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This essay is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution -Noncommercial 3.0 New Zealand licence.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The Akaroa Mail’s first bi-weekly issue was published on July 21 1876. It was begun by the peripatetic ‘rag-planter’ Joseph Ivess who began nearly 30 newspapers in clusters of small towns around New Zealand for three decades from the early 1870s. Ivess sold the Akaroa Mail a year later and there were several owners before, in 1881, the paper was bought by Howard C Jacobson. The Jacobson family was to own and run the newspaper for 71 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; H C Jacobson, from Devon and educated at King’s College, London, was a school teacher before becoming, with Joseph Ivess, a part-owner of the Ashburton Mail, begun in 1877. Sale of his interest in the Ashburton paper helped fund his purchase of the Akaroa Mail. He was to run the newspaper until his death in 1910. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; His daughter Ethel May Jacobson, the seventh of 14 children, excelled at Christchurch Girls’ High School and subsequently gained BA and MA degrees in English and French from Canterbury College. She was teaching in Nelson when, in 1903, her father became ill and called her home to help run the Akaroa Mail. She soon became editor and took full control from 1907, three years before her father died. She was then the legal owner, manager and editor. For almost 50 years, certainly a record, Ethel Jacobson was to remain the Akaroa Mail editor. Later, her younger brother, William took care of the business side of the paper. In time, there were four staff in the printing department. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Possibly Ethel Jacobson’s greatest achievement was her growing acceptance as a pioneering women editor at a time when the role was considered a male preserve. She was to become a familiar figure, with wide-brimmed hat and hobnailed boots, riding side-saddle over Banks Peninsula’s hilly terrain to report meetings and events. There were also launch trips to Pigeon Bay and Port Levy to ensure the detailed coverage that makes the newspaper an invaluable record of Banks Peninsula life. The newspaper was also, during her long editorship, widely respected for the standard of its journalism and high quality printing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ethel Jacobson, who never married, retired in 1952 and died, 88 years old, in 1965. The year she retired the Akaroa Mail was sold to George R Dobbie, who had worked for the Christchurch Star-Sun, and subsequently edited the newspaper for a number of years. In the early 1980s there was a decline in editorial standards and stock photographs were used frequently and often inappropriately. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Publication, continuous since 1876, was interrupted for two months in 1985 before publisher-editor Michael de Hamel took over, restored the previously high standards and substantially increased the paper’s circulation. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

Kotahi tau i muri mai i hokona atu e Ivess te Akaroa Mail, ā, he āhua maha tonu ngā kaipupuri i mua i te hokotanga o te pepa e Howard C Jacobson i te tau 1881. Mō ngā tau 71 i puritia, i whakahaerehia te niupepa e te whānau Jacobson. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō Devon a H C Jacobson, i kuraina ki King’s College, Rānana, he kaiako kura a ia i mua i te hokotanga o te Ashburton Mail e rāua ko Joseph Ivess, i tīmata rā i te tau 1877. Nō te hokotanga atu o tāna wāhanga o te niupepa i whai pūtea āwhina a ia ki te hoko i te Akaroa Mail. Ka whakahaeretia e ia te niupepa tae noa ki tōna matenga i te tau 1910. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I tino puta te ihu o tāna tamāhine o Ethel May Jacobson, te tuawhitu o ngā tamariki 14, i te Kura Tuarua o Christchurch Girls’, ā, nō muri mai i whiwhi a ia i ana tohu Paetahi, Paerua hoki i te reo Ingarihi me te reo Wīwī mai i te Kāreti o Waitaha. He kaiako ia i Whakatū i 1903, ka pāngia tōna matua e te mate ka karangahia a ia kia hoki mai ki te kāinga hei ringa āwhina ki te whakahaere i te Akaroa Mail. Kāore i roa i piki a ia ki te tūranga o te ētita, ā, nō te tau 1907 i riro i a ia te mana whakahaere, e toru tau tērā i mua i te matenga o tōna pāpā. Nā konā ka noho a ia hei kaipupuri ā-ture, kaiwhakahaere, ētita hoki. I tata ki te 50 tau i noho tonu a Ethel Jacobson hei ētita o te Akaroa Mail kāore e kore he tino rongomau tērā. Nō muri mai ka riro i a William, tōna tungāne, te taha pakihi o te niupepa. I roto i te wā ka piki ngā kaimahi o te tari tā ki te whā. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tērā pea ko te tino mahi i tutuki i a Ethel Jacobson ko te whakaaetanga ki tāna mahi hei wahine pakari, hei ētita, i tētahi wā e whakaaro nuitia ana he tūranga kē tērā mā te tāne anake. Ka āhua rongonui haere a ia, tana pōtae pārua-whānui me ana pūtu hopineira, e eke taha-tera ana i te hoiho i runga i ngā puke o Akaroa ki te hopu kōrero mō ngā huihuinga me ngā takahanga. I tua atu hoki ko ngā haereere mā runga waka ki Whakaroa (Pigeon Bay), ki Koukourarata (Port Levy) hoki, hei āta whakarite i te horanga āmiki, nā runga i tērā kua noho te niupepa hei puna kōrero kāmehameha mō te rohe o Akaroa. I te roanga atu o tōna wā roa hei ētita i mihia te niupepa mō te paerewa o āna mahi rīpoata, me te kounga nui hoki o ana mahi tā. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kāore a Ethel Jacobson i mārena, ā, i mutu a ia i te tau 1952, nō te tau 1965 a ia i mate, 88 tau te pakeke. I te tau i mutu ai tana mahi i hokona te Akaroa Mail ki a George R Dobbie, he kaimahi nā te Christchurch Star-Sun, nāna te niupepa i ētita mō ētahi tau. I ngā tau tuatahi o 1980 i heke ko ngā paerewa ētita, ā, i whakamahia auautia ngā whakaahua puna, i ētahi wā anō kāore i tika te whakamahinga. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tūmau ana te whakaputa mai i te tau 1876, engari i kotia mō te rua marama i te tau 1985 i mua i te taenga mai o te kaiwhakaputa-ētita a Michael de Hamel, nā konā i piki anō ai ki ngā paerewa teitei o mua, ā, i piki anō hoki te tokomaha o ngā kaipānui. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

Issued weekly, the cost was 28 shillings per year, 7 shillings per quarter, and single issues 7 pence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1845 Williamson established the English-language newspaper The New Zealander to &amp;lsquo;champion the rights of the Maori&amp;rsquo; (Scholefield, 1958: 80). Wilson, according to Scholefield, believed that it was in the best interests of Maori people for the government to assert its supremacy in New Zealand as quickly as possible (ibid.). To foster this process they combined to print instructions in Maori: for farming and gardening after the English fashion; for keeping bees and taking honey; for making things useful to man &amp;ndash; such as different kinds of food, soap and candles ... together with some simple directions about clothes and physic and matters relating to health (25 April 1848: 2).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This paper is for the most part written in English. There is a Maori section on the last page of each issue which is not translated, nor is it a translation of the English text. The section in Maori was expected to become equal in size to the English section.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scholefield, Guy H.

I whakapono a Wilson, hei tā Scholefield, kotahi anō te huarahi pai hei whakapiki i ngā painga ki te iwi Māori, kia tere tonu te kāwanatanga ki te whakapūmau i tōna mana nui i Aotearoa, kāore he tirohanga ki tēnei taha, ki tēnei taha, me whakaoti wawe te whakaūnga mana (ki taua tuhinga anō). Hei whakahohoro i ēnei āhuatanga i mahi tahi rātou ki te tā tohutohu ki te reo Māori: mō te mahi ahuwhenua, mō te mahi māra kai i runga anō i ngā tikanga Pākehā mō tēnei mahi; mō te tiaki pī, me te nanao mīere; mō te waihanga taonga hei rahurahu mā te tangata - pēnei me ngā kai, te hopi me ngā kānara...tae atu ki ētahi tohutohu māmā mō ngā kākahu, te rongoā hiropi me te hauora (25 Āperira 1848: 2).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I puta tēnei niupepa ki te reo Pākehā i te nuinga o te wā. Tērā tētahi wāhanga mā te Maori i te whārangi whakamutunga o ia putanga kāore i whakamāoritia, ehara hoki te whakamāoritanga o ngā kupu Pākehā.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The Evening Star first appeared in Auckland in January 1870 more by accident than careful design. With ambitions beyond his clerkship at one of Auckland’s morning dailies, the Southern Cross, William Ferrar placed an advertisement seeking a partner in a publishing venture. A former Presbyterian minister, the Rev George McCullagh Reed, responded while passing through Auckland on his way back to Australia from the West Coast goldfields, and the two men met. Despite having little capital, no influential friends and minimal experience, they quickly agreed to begin an afternoon paper, of more liberal persuasion, in opposition to the Evening News. Julius Vogel, manager of the Southern Cross, agreed to print copies of the four page paper, with Reed, who had some writing ability, the editor and Ferrar selling advertisements. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; However, Reed unwisely pushed his temperance views in a town with a proliferation of pubs and taverns; more wisely he sought the advice of the New Zealand Herald’s £5 a week waterfront reporter Henry Brett. Advising that the lack of hard news was the problem, Brett took a third interest in the paper and was soon in charge with a young friend, Thomson Wilson Leys, formerly sub-editor of the Southern Cross, joining him. George Reed continued as editor until 1875, when Leys took over the role. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Brett became sole proprietor of the newspaper which was renamed the Auckland Evening Star in 1879 and Auckland Star in 1887. Brett and Leys subsequently formed a commercial partnership and successive generations of both families continued to play leading roles. The Brett Printing and Publishing Co. Ltd. became a public company in 1920. In 1929, following the purchase of the Lyttelton Times and Christchurch Star, the company became New Zealand Newspapers Ltd. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The newspaper’s growing success through the last decades of the nineteenth century was largely due to Brett’s commitment to providing as up-to-the moment news as possible. Before Auckland was linked to the telegraph, staff boarded arriving ships at the harbour entrance in specially-built boats to pick up English and Australian newspapers. Brett also used a dozen pigeons, from a Tasmanian breeder, to carry daily news from the Thames goldfields and from Tauranga where the telegraph line from Wellington ended in the early 1870s. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was claimed that the Evening Star had a circulation of 2,700 copies in 1872, rising to 4,700 three years later. In 1884, now the Auckland Evening Star, the paper’s circulation had reached 10,000. In 1898, Brett claimed the Auckland Star had the country’s largest afternoon circulation – 15,000 copies a day. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Star was one of the first newspapers in New Zealand to replace hand setting of type with linotype machines. It was also one of the first dailies to make regular use of photographs; the separate weekly magazine, the New Zealand Graphic, begun by Henry Brett in 1890, was illustrated from the beginning. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Auckland Star was a major, innovative metropolitan daily until the early 1960s. Weakened, as most afternoon papers were, by the introduction of television, the Star, and NZ Newspapers Ltd., fell prey to a corporate raider, and ceased publication in 1991. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

I whakamahia hoki ētahi kūkupa kawe kōrero tekau mā rua e Brett, mai i tētahi kaiwhakatupu kūkupa nō Tahimānia, hei kawe i ngā rongo kōrero mai i ngā keringa kōura o Hauraki me Tauranga, te wāhi i mutu atu ai te waea tarikarāwhe i Pōneke i ngā tau tuatahi mai o 1870. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; E kīia ana i taua wā tata ki te 2,700 niupepa te tohanga o te Evening Star i te tau 1872, ā, kua piki ki te 4,700 e toru tau i muri mai. Nō te tau 1884, i raro i te ingoa te Auckland Evening Star, kua piki te tohanga o te niupepa ki te 10,000. I te tau 1898, ka puta te kōrero a Brett kua kake te tohanga o te Auckland Star kia noho koia te tino niupepa ahiahi awatea he nui rawa te tohanga o te motu katoa – 15,000 ngā kape ia rā. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko te Star tētahi o ngā niupepa tuatahi o Aotearoa ki te whakakapi i te tāpae ā-ringa i ngā momotuhi, ki ngā mīhini linotype.

The paper intended to cover a wide area, which can be seen from its rather long subtitle: 'the Takapau, Ormondville, Norsewood, Makotuhu, Dannevirke and Wainui District Advertiser.'&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clayton had installed a quality press and the Bush Advocate was well produced from the start. It did not aim to represent any factional views but sought to serve the business needs of the communities in which it circulated and to report local news faithfully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper began life as a tri-weekly, published on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. In 1893 Clayton sold it to David Curle, who had had extensive experience with Havelock and Wellington newspapers. New owners took over in 1901 and renamed the paper the Dannevirke Advocate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They in turn sold it to Thomas Lindsay Buick and John Ruffell Russell, in 1903. The paper flourished under their control and became a daily, expanding its news gathering service deep into the Hawke's Bay back country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buick had been a Member of Parliament for Wairau, was an accomplished orator and journalist and the author of many books on New Zealand history (including a comprehensive survey of the early history of Marlborough).

It was one of New Zealand’s longest running country newspapers. The Herald was established by Joseph Mackay, a stationer and publisher from Dunedin. The Herald was one of a chain of newspapers that Mackay ran in Otago in the 1860s and 70s. Other papers in the chain included the Mataura Ensign at Gore and the Clutha Times at Balclutha.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

Other papers in the chain included the Mataura Ensign at Gore and the Clutha Times at Balclutha.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Financial difficulties in the late 1870s forced Mackay out of newspaper publishing and in 1879 he sold the Herald to Francis Grant &amp; Co. The paper changed hands several more times over the next fifty years. Reginald Augustus Pyke was probably the most significant of the later owners. Pyke ran and edited the paper several times between 1896 and 1915. His editorial policy was unashamedly parochial as he used the Herald to advance the economic interests of Milton and Bruce County. His lobbying, through the pages of the Herald, was instrumental in attracting a woollen mill to the town. The mill was for many years one of the main employers in Milton.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bruce Herald had a number of rivals in Milton between 1866 and 1910. The most notable were the Bruce Independent (1866-1867) and the Milton Mirror (1905-1910). The Independent provided some real competition for the short time it ran. Under Edward T. Gillon the paper gained much attention locally for its strong anti-provincial editorial policy. The impact of the Independent was such that the Herald increased the size of its issues from 4 to 8 pages. However Gallon’s views were too strong or at least too vigorously expressed for the directors of the Independent and the paper was wound up in 1867. The Milton Mirror was published by Charles Lewis Grant, a former employee of the Herald. The Mirror met with some success but was taken over by the Herald after a fire destroyed the Mirror’s office in 1910.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Herald ceased publication on 7 October 1971.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

He nui anō ngā ringa i whakawhitihia ai te nūpepa i roto i ngā tau e rima tekau i muri mai. Ko Reginald Augustus Pyke pea te tino tangata hira o ngā kaihoko tōmuri. He nui tonu ngā wā nā Pyke te nūpepa i whakahaere, i whakatikatika hoki i waenganui i ngā tau 1896 me 1915. He mea māia tonu te titiro whāiti o tōna kaupapa whakapuaki, i tāna whakamahi hoki i te Herald hei āki whakamua i ngā painga ohaoha o Milton me te takiwā o Bruce.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Bay of Plenty Times is currently one of the New Zealand's largest daily newspapers but for many years its existence was precarious and it came close to folding on a number of occasions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was first produced on 4 September 1872 as a bi-weekly publication. It consisted of four pages in tabloid size and cost three pence per issue. The founder and editor was WB Langbridge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ownership of the Times changed many times over the next 40 years, including several times through mortgagee sales. Despite the hardships the Times issued a Christmas supplement in 1897, which featured one of the earliest use of photographs in New Zealand newspapers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From 1913 the paper enjoyed stability after the Gifford and Cross families took over. Both families were associated with the paper until it was sold to Wilson and Horton in 1992. Ownership changed again in 1996 when Independent Newspapers PC from Dublin acquired a controlling interest in Wilson and Horton.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1976 a fire destroyed the newspaper's entire collection of back issues. Fortunately the publisher had kept copies on microfilm and these are now held by the Alexander Turnbull Library.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Times has prospered in the last 50 years and appears secure. Its progress has been linked with that of the Bay of Plenty, which has grown rapidly and continuously since Mt Maunganui became an export port in the early 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

This had changed by the mid-1860s.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; From the 1840s there was a good early relationship between the Ngati Awa tribe and the slowly growing number of Europeans living in the Whakatane area.

There was widespread Maori adoption of the new Pai Maire religion and the teachings of prophet Te Ua Haumene were peaceful, but the murder of Europeans in the Bay of Plenty by Hau Hau followers resulted in the confiscation of Ngati Awa’s lands. Following Te Kooti’s raid on Whakatane in 1869, there was a determined effort by European settlers and local Maori to re-establish community and economic life in the township. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whakatane had a population of a little over 200 when the first attempt was made to establish a newspaper. The Whakatane Times and Opouriao Advocate began its short life in 1899 but there were not sufficient readers or advertisers for it to survive beyond its first two months. The paper edited by H G Walmsley, was backed by Daniel McGarvey, a one-time compositor on Auckland’s Southern Cross. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1901 there were 781 Europeans and between 3-4,000 Maori in Whakatane County. The township’s population had risen sufficiently by 1907 for the Whakatane County Press, using the Times plant, to have more sustained success. The owner, Charles Gibbs Beckett, was well-known for starting newspapers. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to the Thames Star in January 1907: ‘Mr C G Beckett bids fair to rival the fame of Mr Joseph Ivess as a newspaper ‘planter’. He is the proprietor of the Northern Wairoa Times, the Whangarei Morning Press and the Waihi Times, and he is now establishing a fourth at Whakatane, to be known as the Whakatane County Press. Years ago Mr Beckett established several papers in the Wairarapa district, and for some time he owned the Inglewood Record.’ &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Following the paper’s first issue on 14 January Wellington’s Evening Post reported that it ‘is a double-demy sheet, and claims to be the first penny paper in the Bay of Plenty. As befits a county paper, it gives full prominence to local news and local requirements.’ It appeared three times a week and was published in the morning. It may have been a daily for a time in 1916. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One newspaper, at least, was less welcoming. In December 1907 the Bay of Plenty Times commented: ‘We notice that the Whakatane County Press makes very free with the articles in this paper by publishing them in its leading columns as original matter. We have no objection to incompetent papers copying our articles, provided they acknowledge their source instead of stealing them.’ &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; During the period 1916-1921 Whakatane was the fastest growing town in New Zealand, contributing factors being the congenial climate, fertile alluvial plains and lower hill country and the increasing importance of the port at Whakatane. Forestry, fishing, and dairying were all important. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1919 the Whakatane County Press was bought by the Bay of Plenty Printing Company and in 1923 changed back to evening publication. In 1935, it absorbed the East Coast Guardian from Opotiki and the paper’s title was changed to Bay of Plenty Press. The Bay of Plenty Press stopped publication at the beginning of 1939 and two months later F J Reynolds formed the Beacon Printing and Publishing Company and took over the Press’s machinery. The first issue of the Bay of Plenty Beacon, a tri-weekly, appeared in April 1939. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Whakatane Beacon, as the paper is now called, is a broadsheet publication printed three times a week, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and on Fridays. It has a circulation of about 8,400. The Beacon Printing and Publishing Company also publishes the Bay Weekend, a tabloid newspaper delivered free every Saturday to every home in the greater Eastern Bay area. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Mai i te ngahurutanga tau 1840-1850 he pai tonu te wairua o te noho tahi o te iwi o Ngāti Awa me te tokopae āta tupu o te hunga Pākehā e noho ana i te rohe o Whakatāne. Te taenga ki waenganui i te ngahurutanga 1860-1870, kua puta kē te āhua. Kua tīmata te huri a te tini o ngāi Māori ki te whakapono Pai Mārire. He rangimārie ngā akoranga a te poropiti a Te Ua Haumene, engari nā te kōhurutanga i ngā Pākehā i te Moana a Toi e ngā Hau Hau, ka murua ngā whenua o Ngāti Awa. I muri i te whakaekenga a Te Kooti ki Whakatāne i te tau 1869, ka tīmata anō te kōkiri a ngā kainohonoho Pākehā, me ngā Māori ki te waihanga i te oranga ohaoha, oranga hapori hoki i te tāone. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kei te 200 tāngata te taupori o Whakatane, i te tīmatanga tuatahitanga rawa o ngā mahi whakatū niupepa. I tīmata te oranga poto o te Whakatane Times and Opouriao Advocate i te tau 1899, engari kāore i rahi ngā kaipānui, te hunga whakatairanga hokohoko rānei e ora ai ia, i tua atu i ōna marama tuatahi e rua. He mea ētita te niupepa e H G Walmsley, ā, he mea tautoko e Daniel McGarvey, tētahi o ngā kairaweke tā i te Southern Cross o Tāmaki-makau-rau. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1901 e 781 ngā Pākehā, i waenga hoki i te 3-4,000 ngā Maori i te takiwā o Whakatāne. Nō te taenga ki te tau 1907 kua piki te taupori o te tāone, i āhei ai te Whakatane County Press te whanake, te tū. I whakamahia e ia ngā mīhini o te Times. He rongonui te ingoa o te rangatira a Charles Gibbs Beckett, mō te whakarewa i tēnei mea te niupepa huri noa. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; E ai ki te Thames Star i te marama o Hānuere 1907: ‘E kore pea e kore ka rite te rongo o Mr C G Beckett ki tōna hoa tauwhāinga ki a Mr Joseph Ivess hei 'kaiwhakatō' niupepa. Koia te rangatira o te Northern Wairoa Times, o te Whangarei Morning Press me te Waihi Times, ā, i tēnei wā kei te whakatū ia i tētahi mea tuawhā ki Whakatāne, e mōhiotia ai ko te Whakatane County Press. I ngā tau o mua ka whakatūria e Mr Beckett ētahi niupepa i te takiwā o Wairarapa, ā, koia hoki te rangatira o te Inglewood Record mō tētahi wā.’ &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I muri i te putanga tuatahi o te niupepa i te 14 o Hānuere, ka puta te pūrongo a te Evening Post, i Pōneke, 'he rau double-demy, ā, e mea ana rātou koia te pepa kapa-tahi tuatahi ki te Moana a Toi'. Kia tika ai te kī he pepa ā-takiwā, e kī katoa ana i ngā rongorongo ā-rohe, me ngā kaupapa ā-takiwā.' E toru ōna putanga ia wiki, ā, ka whakaputaina i ngā ata. He niupepa ā-rā mō te wā poto i te tau 1916. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kotahi te niupepa kāore i kaha rawa te tautoko i tōna whānautanga mai. Nō te marama o Tīhema 1907 ka puta te kōrero a te Bay of Plenty Times: 'E kite ana mātou kei te ngana te Whakatāne County Press ki te tāhae i ngā tuhinga rongo kōrero o tēnei niupepa me te pānui anō i aua tuhinga, ānō nei nāna i tito, i tuhi. Kāore kau mātou e whakahē i ngā niupepa kaha-kore e tārua nei i ā mātou tuhinga, engari me whakaingoa i te puna i kitea ai, kaua e haere mai ki te tāhae i aua tuhinga.' &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I waenga i ngā tau 1916-1921 ko Whakatāne tētahi o ngā tāone hohoro rawa ki te tupu i Aotearoa. Ko te take ko te tū o te rangi, he huarere tino mahana, te mōmona o te oneone o ngā raorao, o ngā pārae, ngā hiwi o raro, me te pikinga ake o te mana o te wahapū i Whakatane. He mea tino nui anō hoki te tope rākau, te hī ika, me te mahi kūtētē kau. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te tau 1919 ka hokona te Whakatane County Press e te Bay of Plenty Printing Company, ā, nō te tau 1923 ka hoki anō hei putanga ā-ahiahi. I te tau 1935, ka horomia e ia te East Coast Guardian o Ōpōtiki, ka hurihia te taitara ki te Bay of Plenty Press. I mutu te putanga o te Bay of Plenty Press i te tīmatanga o 1939. E rua marama i muri mai nā F J Reynolds i whakatū te Beacon Printing and Publishing Company, ā, ka riro i a ia ngā mīhini o te Press. I puta mai te putanga tuatahi o te Bay of Plenty Beacon, he toru putanga ia wiki, i te marama o te Āperira 1939. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; E kīa ana ināianei ko te Whakatane Beacon. He putanga whārangi whānui ia, ā, e toru ōna putanga ia wiki i te Tūrei, i te Wenerei, me te Paraire hoki. E 8,400 ōna kape ka hokona. Kei te whakaputa te Beacon Printing and Publishing Company i te Bay Weekend, he niupepa ā-papa, ki ia kāinga i te rohe whānui o te Moana ā-Toi ki te Rāwhiti. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

There were also 53 hotels at Brighton or nearby and a further 37 at Charleston. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After John Tyrrell had begun the Westport Times in 1866 he opportunistically added Charleston Argus to the title and briefly moved his plant to the new settlement. The Brighton Times and Pakihi Reporter had appeared earlier but was absorbed into the stand-alone Charleston Argus after it was launched in March 1867. Tyrrell dropped the ‘Charleston Argus’ add-on from his Westport paper’s masthead in 1869.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Wellington’s Evening Post reported on 9 March: ‘Judging from the manner in which the Press is supported in gold fields districts, we may safely prognosticate for our contemporary a lucrative existence until the rich country of the Buller is worked out. The management are experienced journalists, and will probably bring out the new journal in such a manner as to ensure for it a cordial reception.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In its first issue the Charleston Argus was bullish about prospects: ‘On the middle flat fortune is variable, but on the whole the fickle goddess is favourable to the miners. Water is greatly needed, however, and if this is got there is from two to three years' work before the claimholders. Fuller and party have been at work about three months here. They have cut a water race, and are now ground sluicing, and average from £10 to £14 per man per week.’ (From about $1,000 to nearly $1,500 today.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The well-produced bi-weekly was subsequently renamed Charleston Herald and Mining Reporter by Charles Mirfin, who later became editor of the Inangahua Herald. A further change came when the latter part of the name was dropped in favour of Brighton Times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; John Tyrrell, an Irishman, emigrated to the United States after finishing his apprenticeship and worked there for some years. He arrived in Australia in 1859-1860 and was compositor on the Melbourne Chronicle and Ballarat Times before moving to New Zealand. After a period on The Press in Christchurch he moved to Hokitika, beginning the Hokitika Chronicle as well as the Westport Times and Charleston Argus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1886, Thomas Dolman, proprietor for some years, sold the paper to Irish journalist Patrick Kittson, who had served his apprenticeship as a printer on the Melbourne Argus. When he died in 1893 his widow and children continued the business. First, Norah Kittson’s two sons, aged 12 and 10, largely ran the paper and, following their early deaths from TB in 1902, she and her daughters continued to publish, firstly as a weekly and then more irregularly, until 1911. By this time Charleston Riding’s population had dwindled to 264. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I kitea hoki te kōura i Brighton, 10 māero ki te tonga, i taua tau anō. I te tau 1867 kua eke te taupori katoa o ngā keringa kōura i Charleston me Brighton ki te takiwā o 11,000. Kua eke ki te 53 ngā hōtēra i Brighton i kō tata atu rānei, me tōna 37 hōtēra anō ki Charleston. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I muri i te tīmatanga a John Tyrrell i te Westport Times i te tau 1866 ka tāpiritia e ia te Charleston Argus ki te taitara ā, ka nekehia e ia ana mīhini ki te kāinga hou. Kua puta kē noa atu te Brighton Times and Pakihi Reporter engari i whakahanumitia ki roto i te nūpepa tū motuhake o te Charleston Argus i muri i tōna whakarewanga i te marama o Māehe i te tau 1867. I whakarērea e Tyrrell te tāpiritanga o te Charleston Argus i te pane kōrero o tana nūpepa i Westport i te tau 1869. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; E ai ki te pūrongo a te Evening Post o Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara i te 9 Māehe: ‘Ina tiro tātou ki ngā tini tautoko a te iwi i tēnei mea te Nūpepa i ngā rohe keri kōura, tēnei mātou te matapae nei tērā e puta he oranga nui mā tō tātou hoa nūpepa, kia pau rā anō ngā keringa kōura mōmona o te Kawatiri. He mātanga katoa ngā kaiwhakahaere, ā, he mōhio rātou ki te whakaputa i te nūpepa hou kia ātaahua ki te hunga pānui, e tino paingia ai e te iwi katoa.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I tōna putanga tuatahi i te hīkaka katoa ngā kōrero o te Charleston Argus ki te takahi i te huarahi ki te ora mō ngā kaikeri o te rohe: ‘I te pārae o waenganui he āhua pai ngā whiwhinga, engari mō te nuinga e atawhaitia ana ngā kaikeri kōura e ngā atua wāhine o te whenua. E tino hiahiatia ana he wai, ā, ki te taea tēnei taonga te wai ka haere pea te kerēme mō te rua ki te toru tau. Kua toru marama a Fuller mā e mahi ana i konei. Kua tapahia e rātou he rerenga wai, kei te horohoroi i te kirikiri, ā, tōna toharite mai i te £10 ki te £14 te hua mā ia tangata i te wiki.’ (Mai i te $1,000 ki te $1,500 i ngā moni o nāianei.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I whakaingoatia anō te nūpepa rua putanga i te wiki, he nūpepa tino pai hoki, ko te Charleston Herald and Mining Reporter e Charles Mirfin. Nō muri ka eke ia hei etita mō te Inangahua Herald. Ka puta hoki tētahi rerekētanga mō te ingoa tuarua o te ingoa i te hurihanga ki te Brighton Times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ka wehe atu a John Tyrrell, tētahi tangata Airihi ki Amerika i muri i te otinga o ana tau akoako, ā, ka mahi i reira mō ētahi tau. Ka tae atu ia ki Ahitereiria i te tau 1859-1860 ā, koia te kaitā i te Melbourne Chronicle me te Ballarat Times i mua i tana nukuhanga mai ki Aotearoa. I muri i tētahi wā i The Press i Ōtautahi ka nuku ia ki Hokitika, tīmata i Hokitika Chronicle tae atu hoki ki te Westport Times me te Charleston Argus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1886, nā Thomas Dolman, te kaihautū mō ētahi tau i hoko te nūpepa ki te kaituhi Airihi ki a Patrick Kittson. I ako a Patrick i tana mahi tuatahi, te mahi kaitā i te Melbourne Argus. I tōna matenga i te tau 1893 ka kawea haeretia e tōna pouaru me āna tamariki te umanga. I te tuatahi nā ngā tama e rua a Norah Kittson, 12 me te 10 tau te pakeke, i whakahaere te nūpepa, me kī te nuinga rā, ā, i muri i tō rātou matenga i te mate kohi i te tau 1902, nā rātou ko ana tamāhine i whakaputa te nūpepa, i te tuatahi hei nūpepa ā-wiki, ā, he āhua tīmutumutu i muri, taea noatia te tau 1911. I te taenga ki tērā wā kua iti haere te taupori o Charleston Riding ki te 264. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The Press published its first weekly issue on 25 May 1861 – a six page paper every Saturday costing 6d – a decade after the Lyttelton Times made its appearance as Canterbury’s first newspaper. But it did have the distinction, in March 1863, of being the province’s first daily – 5,000 copies of the four-page paper were printed, selling for 3d a copy. Shortly afterwards, advertisements replaced articles on the front page. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1861, the principal backer was James Edward FitzGerald, Canterbury’s first superintendent and MP for Lyttelton – and also the Lyttelton Times’ first editor. FitzGerald, returning to Canterbury after an extended period back in England, disapproved of the extravagant and ambitious plans – including a Lyttelton rail tunnel – of his successor William Moorhouse. As the Lyttelton Times supported Moorhouse’s expensive schemes, FitzGerald, and like-minded settlers, put up the capital to underwrite a rival publication with a different vision for Christchurch. In the beginning, with FitzGerald writing most of the first few issues, there were violent attacks on Moorhouse and his policies but before long the paper adopted the sober, sensible standards that, over the following decades, established The Press’s reputation as New Zealand’s principal ‘journal of record’. An early contributor was Samuel Butler who wrote articles for The Press that were later woven into his famous book Erewhon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; James FitzGerald was nominally sole owner of The Press for several years, although financially indebted to two leading Canterbury businessmen. His association with The Press diminished and later ended following his acceptance of a government appointment in Wellington in 1867. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Technical innovation became a speciality of the private companies that owned The Press, with differing shareholdings, for the next century. In 1893, the Weekly Press, which began in 1865 as a news digest for country districts, produced its Christmas number with a full-colour lithographed art cover and, for the first time, half-tone blocks illustrated the articles. In 1917, Mona McKay became one of the first ‘lady reporters’ in the country to work in a general reporters’ room, long a male preserve. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Prominent staff members included Guy Scholefield, who was associate editor of The Press (1903-04), London correspondent of the NZ Associated Press (1908-19) and later, for 22 years, Parliamentary Librarian at the General Assembly Library. While Oliver Duff was editor from 1929-1932 well-known contributors included Ngaio Marsh, Monte Holcroft and D’Arcy Cresswell. Duff resigned over editorial policy differences with the board involving a tramway strike; in 1939 he became the founding editor of the NZ Listener. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1970 the Christchurch Press Co. Ltd. listed on the NZ Stock Exchange; in 1987 Independent Newspapers Ltd took control; and in 2003 ownership passed to the Fairfax Group. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; I whakaputaina e te Press tana putanga ā-wiki tuatahi i te 25 o May 1861 – he pepa e ono ngā whārangi ia Rāhoroi 6d te utu – tekau tau tēnei i muri i te putanga o te Lyttelton Times te niupepa tutahi o Waitaha. Heoi anō i whai ingoa ai te pepa nō te mea i te marama o Maehe 1863, koia te pepa tuatahi o taua rohe kia whakaputaina ā-rā – 5,000 ngā kape o te pepa e whā ana whārangi i tāngia, i hokona ia kape mō te 3d. Nō muri tata mai, i whakakapia ngā tuhinga i te whārangi tuatahi ki ngā pānui. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1861, ko te kaitautoko matua ko James Edward FitzGerald, he kaiwhakahaere tuatahi mō Waitaha, he MP hoki mō Lyttelton – ko ia hoki te ētita tuatahi o te Lyttelton Times. I tana hokinga mai ki Waitaha i muri i te wā roa ki Ingarangi i whakahēngia e FitzGerald ngā kaupapa tōtōā, whakaaro nui hoki o tana kaiwhakakapi a William Moorhouse – tae atu ki te arapoka tereina o Lyttleton. Nā runga i te mea e tautokohia ngā kaupapa nui te utu a Moorhouse e te Lyttleton Times, i huri a FitzGerald me ētahi atu tāngata he ōrite ngā whakaaro ki te whakarite pūtea hei tīmata i tētahi niupepa kē e whakahau ana i tētahi kaupapa matakite kē mō Ōtautahi. I te tīmatatanga, i runga i te mea ko FitzGerald te kaituhi o ngā putanga tuatahi, he kaha tana whakahē i a Moorhouse me ana kaupapahere, heoi anō kāore i roa i tīmata te whakamahinga o ngā paerewa mārama, whai tikanga hoki e te niupepa, nō konā, i ngā tau whai muri mai hoki, i whakatūria te ingoa o te Press hei 'pūrongo tika pū' matua ki Aotearoa. Ko tētahi o ngā kaitakoha tuatahi ko Samuel Butler, nāna ētahi tuhinga i tito mō te Press, ā, i muri mai i tuituia atu ki roto i tana pukapuka rongonui Erewhon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Me kī ko James FitzGerald te kaipupuri tūtahi o te Press mō ētahi tau, ahakoa i te noho nama ia ki ngā kaipakihi matua e rua o Waitaha. I pōturi haere ka mutu hoki ana pānga ki te Press i muri i tana whiwhinga o tētahi tūranga kāwanatanga ki Pōneke i te tau 1867. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko te whai i ngā āhuatanga hou te tino whai a ngā kamupene tūmataiti e whakahaere ana i te Press, i runga i ngā pupuritanga-hea rerekē, mō te rau tau whai muri mai. I te tau 1893 i whakaputaina e te Weekly Press, he mea i tīmatangia i te tau 1865 hei pānui pitopito kōrero ki ngā rohe kōraha, tana nama Kirihimete ki tētahi ūwhi toi kua tāngia ki ngā tae-katoa, ā, ko te wā tuatahi hoki i tātuhitia ngā tuhinga ki ngā paraka tae-haurua. I te tau 1917, i tīmata a Mona McKay ki te mahi i te rūma kairīpoata whānui, tētahi o ngā 'wahine kairīpoata' tuatahi i te motu ki te mahi i reira, kua roa tērā he wāhi mā te tāne anake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko ētahi o ngā kaimahi rongonui ko Guy Scholefield, he ētita tuarua o te Press (1903-04), he kaituhi ki Rānana mō te NZ Associated Press (1908-19), ā, i muri i tērā, mō ngā tau 22, ko ia hoki te Parliamentary Librarian ki te General Assembly Library. Ko Oliver Duff te ētita mai i te 1929-1932, ko ētahi o ngā kaitakoha rongonui ko Ngaio Marsh, ko Monte Holcroft me D'Arcy Cresswell. I heke a Duff i tana tūranga i runga i ngā tohenga kaupapahere ētita ki te poari e pā ana ki tētahi taraiki o ngā terēme, i 1939 ko ia te ētita tuatahi o te NZ Listener. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I 1970 i whakarārangihia te Christchurch Press Co. Ltd ki te NZ Stock Exchange, i 1987 i riro te mana whakahaere i te Independent Newspapers Ltd, ā, i 2003 i whakawhitia te kaipupuritanga ki te Fairfax Group. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

They discovered that Robert Carrick was also intending to start a newspaper in Cromwell but decided to go ahead with their plans after Carrick assured them he would not proceed with his venture. However, Carrick reneged on his promise and decided to go ahead with the Cromwell Guardian. The race was on to be first and on Saturday 6 November 1869 Fenwick set off from Lawrence on horse-back with 500 copies of the first edition of the Argus strapped on at the front of his saddle. After riding all day Sunday, Fenwick arrived in Cromwell and before breakfast on Monday he had distributed all of the papers.

I reira i kite rāua i mea a Robert Carrick ki te whakatū niupepa i Cromwell, engari i tau ō rāua whakaaro me haere tonu tā rāua mahi, i muri i te oati a Carrick kua kore ia e whakatinana i tana whakaaro.

Cromwell was not large enough to support two newspapers and the rival Cromwell Guardian only lasted a short time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;George Fenwick transferred his interest in the Argus to his brother William in 1871 and went on to be a major figure in the New Zealand newspaper industry, editing and managing the Otago Daily Times for many years and playing a key role in the establishment of the United Press Association. Matthews and William Fenwick sold the Argus to Stephen Noble Brown in 1875; Brown ran the Argus successfully for 12 years and subsequently moved to Dunedin where he was involved with the Evening Herald. William Fenwick went on to achieve prominence as editor of the Otago Witness for 27 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Argus had a long-running battle with its near neighbour the Dunstan Times which was based in Clyde, fuelled by antagonism between the editors and the rivalry between Cromwell and Clyde. The tone of the relationship is exemplified by an article in the Argus in February 1876 which referred to the &amp;lsquo;bilious venom&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;wild ravings&amp;rsquo; of the Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1899 a rival closer to home appeared with the arrival of the Cromwell Times, established by Patrick Dunne who had previously been associated with the Mt Benger Mail. The Lake Wakatip Mail commented that the Times was launching at a time that &amp;lsquo;looks like a sea of trouble and an amount of cut-throat business which is good for neither God nor man&amp;rsquo;. &amp;nbsp;This proved to be prescient with the Times going into liquidation in 1900.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last issue of the Argus was published on 26 October 1948.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The Dominion was launched on the first Dominion Day, September 26, 1907, with the specific purpose of providing a strong conservative voice in the capital where the other morning paper, the New Zealand Times, was poorly run and had a Liberal Party heritage, and the much stronger Evening Post was more interested in business than party politics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When the morning daily was launched just a year after Richard John Seddon’s death, the Liberals had been in power for 16 years and would be for another five. However, under Sir Joseph Ward, the party was in decline while the Dominion’s directors and shareholders were an impressive list of leading conservative MPs and substantial Canterbury, Hawke’s Bay and Wairarapa runholders. Of particular concern to them were the Liberal policies on labour laws, pensions and land tenure, including the break-up of large rural estates. Unsurprisingly, the newspaper was a persuasive promoter of William Massey’s Reform Party and its policies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first editor – and he held that position, except for three years in the 1930s, until 1950 – was Charles Westwood Earle. He was also the newspaper company’s managing-director for much of the period and well-attuned to the singular requirements of his Wellington Publishing Company board. While landowner interests were pushed and ‘labour agitators’ attacked, the newspaper also supported good working conditions and backed free education. More predictably, the Dominion promoted free trade within the British Empire, sat on the fence over liquor issues, and advocated a ‘white NZ’ immigration policy. From the beginning, the newspaper’s ambitions stretched well beyond the urban confines of Wellington. There was a strong emphasis on farming news to attract readers in the Wairarapa, Manawatu and Hawke’s Bay, with correspondents in Masterton, Palmerston North and Hastings. The paper’s initial circulation of 2,600 had risen to 20,500 by 1914. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; By 1927, the Wellington Publishing Company was in a strong enough position to buy and close down the New Zealand Times. A year later it moved into the impressive, purpose-built six-storey building in Mercer Street that it occupied until 1970. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over the decades, the Dominion’s political stance slowly modified. Shocked by Labour’s 1935 election win, the paper congratulated the new prime minister Michael Joseph Savage but was soon vigorously attacking the government’s ‘socialist’ policies. The hostility of the Dominion and other newspapers led to the launching of the Labour Party’s own daily newspaper, the Southern Cross, in Wellington. It was the first morning opposition to the Dominion – in both political and circulation terms – since the closure of the New Zealand Times. In 1959, eight years after the Southern Cross had closed, Wellington Publishing Company directors reaffirmed their support for the monarchy and British traditions, freedom of speech and private enterprise, but conceded there might be occasions ‘where the need for state interference was clearly shown’. There was now no direct link to any political party. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the 1960s, the Dominion supported New Zealand’s involvement in the Vietnam War, but also joined with environmentalists in opposing the raising of Lake Manapouri. The paper introduced front page news in 1963 and pioneered the use of bylines by journalists. Between 1968-1972 it was published as a tabloid before reverting to a broadsheet format. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1964, Lord Thomson’s attempt to buy the Wellington Publishing Company triggered a takeover war, with Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch the ultimate beneficiary. The 1965 Media Ownership Act limited ownership of New Zealand media companies to 20 percent, but Murdoch’s share gradually increased to 49 percent – giving his News Corporation effective control – after the legislation was repealed in 1974. In 1972, when the companies owning the Dominion and rival Evening Post merged, the resulting Independent Newspapers Ltd (INL) grew rapidly through a succession of takeovers to become one of two dominant media companies in New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In July 2002, INL’s two Wellington newspapers merged to become the morning Dominion-Post. The next year, Fairfax Media, the Australian media conglomerate, purchased, for $1 billion, most of the publishing interests of INL, including the Dominion-Post. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

He tino kaitautoko tēnei niupepa i te Pāti Reform o William Massey, me ōna kaupapa here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko te etita tuatahi ko Charles Westwood Earle, ā, ka puritia e ia taua tūranga taea noatia te ngahuru tau mai i 1950, hāunga ia ētahi toru tau i muri i 1930.

Mai o te tīmatanga, i whātoro atu ngā moemoeā o te niupepa ki hea noa atu i ngā whaitua whāiti noa o Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara. Tērā anō hoki te whānuitanga atu o ngā pitopito kōrero mai i te Wairarapa, i Manawatū, i Te Matau ā-Māui, me ngā kaituhi i Māhitāone, i Papaioea, me Heretaunga.

Kotahi tau i muri mai kua nuku mai ki tētahi whare e ono paparanga te tiketike i te Tiriti o Mercer, i nōhia e ia taea noatia te tau 1970. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I roto i ngā ngahuru tau, ka āhua rerekē haere te tūnga tōrangapū o te Dominion. Ka tumeke te niupepa i te wikitōria o Reipa i te tau 1935, ā, ka huri te niupepa ki te mihi ki te Pirīmia hou ki a Michael Joseph Savage engari kāore i roa i muri mai ka huri ki te ngangau i ngā kaupapa here ‘socialist’ a te Kāwanatanga. Nā ngā whakahē a te Dominion me ētahi atu niupepa ka huri ngā uniana ki te whakarewa i te niupepa motuhake a te Pāti Reipa, te Southern Cross, i Pōneke. Koinei te hoa whawhai tuatahi i ngā ata mō te Dominion – whawhai ā-tōrangapū, whawhai ā-tohanga hoki – mai i te katinga o te New Zealand Times. Nō te tau 1959, e waru tau i muri i te katinga o te Southern Cross, kua tino huri ngā kaihautū o te Wellington Publishing Company ki te whakaū i tā rātou tautoko kaha i te mana o te Kuini o Ingarangi, me ngā tikanga tuku iho o Ingarangi, te wātea ki te kōrero, ki te hautū i ngā mahi kaipakihi hoki. Ahakoa tērā, i whakaae anō rātou tērā tonu ngā wā ‘e tika ana kia uru mai te ringaringa o te kāwanatanga whenua.’ Kāore kau he here tōtika, mai o tērā wā, ki tētahi pāti tōrangapū. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te ngahuru tau mai i 1960, i tautoko te Dominion i te hononga o Aotearoa hei whenua pakanga ki te Pakanga i Whitinamu, engari i tūhono anō ki te hunga tiaki kaitaiao i whakahē ki te whakatōremitanga o te roto o Manapouri. Nā tēnei niupepa i whakauru mai ngā tikanga tā rongo kōrero i te whārangi mātāmua i te tau 1963, ā, nāna i tīmata te mahi haina ā-ingoa a ngā kaikawe kōrero. I waenga i ngā tau 1968-1972 ka whakaputaina hei tēpara, kātahi ka hoki ki te hōputu whārangi rahi. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1964, nā te kōkiri a Lord Thomson ki te hoko i te Wellington Publishing Company i tīmata tētahi pakanga hoko ohorere, ā, ko te kaiwhakaputa nō Ahitereiria ko Rupert Murdoch te toa i te mutunga iho. Nā te 1965 Media Ownership Act i whakaheke te āhei o te hunga o tāwāhi ki te hoko hea i ngā kamupene pāpāho o Aotearoa ki te 20 ōrau, engari i āta piki haere ano ngā puritanga a Murdoch ki te 49 ōrau. Nā konei ka riro te mana nui i tōna News Corporation, i muri i te mukunga atu o taua ture i te tau 1974. I te tau 1972, ka hanumi ngā kamupene nāna te Dominion me tōna hoa tauwhāinga te Evening Post, ā, ka tino whanake haere te kamupene i hua ake, a Independent Newspapers Ltd (INL) rā roto i ngā hoko ohorere maha. Ko tēnei kamupene tētahi o ngā tino kamupene pāpāho nui whakaharahara e rua o Aotearoa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te marama o Hūrae 2002, ka hanumi ngā niupepa e rua o Pōneke o INL kia kotahi te niupepa, ko te Dominion-Post o te ata. I te tau i muri mai nā Fairfax Media, te kamupene tōpū nui o Ahitereiria, i hoko te nuinga o ngā hea whakaputa niupepa, pukapuka o INL, tae atu ki te Dominion-Post mō te 1 piriona tāra. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Southern Cross was started as a weekly paper in Auckland in 1843 by prominent businessman and aspiring politician, William Brown. It was one of the two early newspapers in Auckland that ran for any length of time, the other being its main rival, the New Zealander.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first editor of the Southern Cross was Samuel Martin who had earlier edited the New Zealand Herald and Auckland Gazette for a short time in 1842.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the existence of two other papers in Auckland at the time (the Auckland Chronicle and Auckland Times) the Southern Cross developed reasonably well until 1845, when war with Māori in Northland adversely affected business in Auckland. As a result the paper stop publishing from April 1845 to July 1847.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1847 Campbell revived the Southern Cross to counteract another Auckland newspaper, the New Zealander which had started two years earlier in June 1845. The two papers represented the rival factions in Auckland politics. The New Zealander supported the ordinary settler and Māori while the Southern Cross supported the land claimants and vigorously attacked Governor George Grey's administration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this time there was nothing unusual in the highly partisan attitudes of these papers. Before 1870, newspapers in New Zealand were primarily set up for political purposes. In the absence of self-government newspapers were the main way that those who weren't officials could participate in government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1862 the Southern Cross became the first daily newspaper in Auckland, changing its name to the Daily Southern Cross. The New Zealander soon followed suit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1869 Julius Vogel assumed control of the paper but left to take up national office before he could do much with it, selling his interest in 1873. The paper had always struggled to pay its way. In the 1870s the owners were faced with the expense of shifting (the Improvement Commissioners planned to put a street through their property) and unable to agree on the direction that the paper should take. They decided to sell up instead. Alfred Horton bought the paper in 1876 and went into partnership with the Wilson brothers who owned the New Zealand Herald. At the end of that year the Southern Cross was incorporated into the Herald.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Southern Cross had started the Weekly News in 1863 and when the Southern Cross was incorporated into the Herald, the Weekly News was merged with the Weekly Herald to become the Auckland Weekly News.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New Zealander and the Southern Cross are good examples of the way the country's press was politically aligned at the time and this was mirrored in other centres around New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; In February 1871, when Napier’s population was 2,179, the Daily Telegraph made its first, inauspicious appearance. With a liberal political stance – equal rights and opportunities for all – it was launched to combat the dominance of powerful land interests, and campaigned from the beginning for the break-up of the largest land blocks in Hawke’s Bay. Managing-director and founding editor, Richard Halkett Lord, a London journalist, even suffered a horsewhipping when his witty and pungent pen outraged a reader. However, the founding company was soon in financial difficulties and was wound-up 12 months later. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The newspaper was then taken over by four of its principal shareholders: Edward W Knowles (merchant), George E Lee (barrister), Alexander Kennedy and Thomas K Newton. None had a journalistic background, but Robert Price, who replaced Richard Lord, remained editor until 1893. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Daily Telegraph’s coverage was in sharp contrast to the more conservative, ‘establishment’ views expressed by its already well-established competitor, the Hawke’s Bay Herald, which moved from bi-weekly to daily publication early in 1871 in response to the appearance of the new paper. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Initially, the Daily Telegraph consisted of four (48cm x 34cm) pages, each with five columns. Usually six of the 20 columns carried news, with advertising filling the other 14. Advertising cost 3s per inch and the newspaper sold for 2d. Typesetting was by hand and the paper was printed on a single-sheet hand press. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1879, the Daily Telegraph and Hawke’s Bay Herald’s circulations hovered around the 1,500 copies a day mark, but from 1880 the evening paper began to outpace its morning rival. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Daily Telegraph office in Tennyson Street, Napier was completely destroyed during a major fire on December 18 1886. For a period, until new premises were built, a small news sheet was produced every evening at a local printing office. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; By 1891, with the retirement of his partners, Edward Knowles had become sole proprietor and in 1908 when he, in turn, retired, the newspaper company was sold to the already substantial Auckland newspaper group controlled by Henry Brett, Thomson W Leys and William J Geddis. Geddis, a member of the Legislative Council, became managing-director, beginning a long family association with the newspaper. His son Trevor M Geddis, succeeded him as managing-director in 1921 and became editor in 1929, remaining in that position until 1951. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Until 1982, Daily Telegraph ownership had remained in the hands of descendants of the three families that bought the newspaper in 1908, but in that year it merged with the Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune. Two years later the new company became part of New Zealand News, then a Brierley Investments subsidiary. In 1988, New Zealand News sold its Hawke’s Bay interests to Wilson &amp; Horton which, in turn, was bought by APN NZ in 1996. Although the companies behind the two Hawke’s Bay newspapers had come together in 1982, it was not until 1999 that the Daily Telegraph and Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune merged to become Hawke’s Bay Today. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

I runga i tōna tū tōrangapū, atawhai hoki – kia ōrite ngā motika, kia whai wāhi hoki te katoa – i whakaritea kia whawhai i te mana o ngā rōpū pupuri whenua tino kaha nei, ā, i tohe hoki i te tīmatatanga mō te whakawehenga o ngā paraka whenua i Te Matau-a-Māui. I tētahi wā, nā te whiu noa o tana pene atamai, pūkanekane nei i rīria te kaiwhakahaere matua, te ētita tuatahi hoki, a Richard Halkett Lord, he kairīpoata nō Rānana (London), e tētahi kaipānui, ka wepua rawatia. Heoi anō, nō te paunga o te 12 marama kua raru ā-pūtea, ka pekerapu te kamupene. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō muri mai ka riro te mana o te niupepa i tētahi tokowhā o ngā kaipupuri hea matua: Ko Edward W Knowles (kaihoko), rātou ko George E Lee (rōia), ko Alexander Kennedy ko Thomas K Newton. Kāore rātou i ahu mai i te ao kairīpoata, engari i noho mai a Robert Price tae noa ki te tau 1893, nōna te tūranga te ētita i muri i a Richard Lord. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He rerekē katoa te kōrero a te Daily Telegraph ki ngā tirohanga whānui ‘mana o te wā’ e whakapuakina ana e tōna hoariri kua roa e tū ana, e te Hawke’s Bay Herald, i nekehia tērā mai i te whakaputa niupepa ia rua wiki ki te whakaputa niupepa ia rā i 1871 hei urupare ki te putanga mai o te pepa hou. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tīmatanga e whā ngā (48hm x 34hm) whārangi, e rima ngā tīwae o te Daily Telegraph. I te nuinga o te wā i whakakīa e ono o ngā tīwae 20 ki ngā rongo kōrero, ko te 14 i tua atu i ērā i whakakīa ki ngā pānui hokohoko. Ko te utu o te pānui hokohoko ko te 3s ia īnihi, ā ka hokona ngā pepa mō te 2d. I mahia ā-ringatia te whakarite pū rārangi, ā i tāngia te pepa ki te perehi ā-ringa rau-kotahi. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1879, he tata ki te 1,500 ngā kape ia rā te tohanga o ia pepa, te Daily Telegraph me te Hawke’s Bay Herald, engari mai i te tau 1880 i tīmata te piki haere o ngā kaipānui o te pepa o te ahiahi i tōna hoariri o te ata. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I turakina katoatia te tari o te Daily Telegraph i te Tiriti o Tennyson, Ahuriri e tētahi ahi nui i te 18 o Tīhema 1886. Mō tētahi wā, tae noa ki te hanganga o te whare hou, i whakaputaina he rau rongo kōrero iti ia ahiahi i tētahi tari tā paetata. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Hei te tau 1891, i te hekenga o ōna hoa pakihi, ka riro i a Edward Knowles te mana whakahaere, ā, i 1908 i te wā ka heke ia, i hokona te kamupene niupepa ki tētahi rōpū niupepa nui i Tāmaki-makau-rau e whakahaeretia ana e Henry Brett, Thomson W Leys rātou ko William J Geddis. Ka riro i a Geddis, he mema o te Kaunihera Ture, te tūranga o te kaiwhakahaere matua, nā konā i tīmata he hononga roa i waenga i tōna whānau me te niupepa. Nā tana tama a Trevor M Geddis, ia i whai ake hei kaiwhakahaere matua i te tau 1921, ā, nō te tau 1929 ka riro i a ia te tūranga o te ētita, i noho tonu a ia ki taua tūranga tae noa ki te tau 1951. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tae atu ki te tau 1982, ka noho tonu te Daily Telegraph i ngā ringa a ngā uri o ngā whānau e toru nā rātou te niupepa i hoko i 1908, engari i taua tau i hanumi atu ki te Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune. E rua tau ki muri i uru atu te kamupene hou ki te New Zealand News, he āpitihanga tērā o Brierley Investments. I 1988, i hokona e te New Zealand News āna hea o Te Matau-a-Māui ki Wilson &amp; Horton, nō muri mai i 1996 ka hokona tērā e APN NZ. Ahakoa kua whakakotahitia ngā kamupene e rua o ngā niupepa e rua o Te Mata-a-Māui i te tau 1982, nō te tau 1999 rawa i hanumi te Daily Telegraph me te Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune kia puta ko te Hawke’s Bay Today. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

It read: &amp;lsquo;The matter is of that style peculiar to a gold field, and infinitely better written than the rubbish that disgraced its predecessor.&amp;rsquo; There is other evidence to suggest that the Dunstan News continued to at least December 1864.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dunstan Times, a bi-weekly for a period, was run by George Fache for more than a quarter century. A Londoner, George Fache was attracted to the Southern Hemisphere by the Australian and New Zealand goldfields. After Gabriel&amp;rsquo;s Gully, he was part of the &amp;lsquo;rush&amp;rsquo; to the Dunstan goldfield &amp;ndash; and stayed. As well as running the Dunstan Times until 1895, he had an auctioneering and commission agency business in Clyde.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper was later controlled by the Stevens family. &amp;nbsp;In 1948, Stevens Bros amalgamated Clyde&amp;rsquo;s Dunstan Times, which they then owned, and the Lake County Mail in Queenstown with their Alexandra Herald and Central Otago Gazette. The resulting Central Otago News was published twice weekly (Tuesdays and Thursdays), and based in Alexandra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of 2015, the Lakes District and Central Otago News was a tabloid weekly, owned by Allied Press, publishers of the Otago Daily Times.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Launched in 1880, the Ellesmere Guardian was the second newspaper published in the Ellesmere area, Joseph Ivess having commenced the Ellesmere Advertiser just two days before. Both papers were published in Southbridge. The Advertiser didn’t see out the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Charles Edmund Sherlock, the publisher of the Guardian, had previously worked on the Ashburton Mail before moving to Southbridge. In 1886 Robert George Park assumed control. He had been a partner in the business for several years. Park moved the Guardian office to Leeston. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The next few years appear to have been difficult ones for the Guardian. Publication was suspended in the late 1880s and the paper changed hands frequently. Things improved in 1892 when William Zouch, formerly of the Ashburton Guardian, moved the paper back to Southbridge. Circulation soon rose from 800 to 1200 issues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1897 Cecil Rhys Thornton became editor. He was an ardent prohibitionist and used the paper to promote this cause. His zealousness landed him in court in 1899 when he was sued for libel for comments made in the paper. Thornton left to work on the Inangahua Times in 1904. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Horace McMillan, a 19 year old reporter on the paper, bought the Guardian in 1908 and remained in charge until retiring in 1947. Under his management the paper flourished, becoming one of the better country newspapers in the Dominion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; McMillan moved operations back to Leeston in 1916. The paper remained there until it merged with the Malvern Record to form the Central Canterbury News in 1983. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Note: only two issues of the Guardian are known to exist before 1891. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; He mea whakarewa i te 1880, ko te Ellesmere Guardian te nūpepa tuarua kia tāngia i te rohe o Ellesmere, nō ngā rā e rua o mua tata noa ka tāngia ai e Joseph Ivess te Ellesmere Advertiser. He mea tā aua pepa e rua nei i Southbridge. Kīhai i pau te tau, ka kore noa te Advertiser. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I mua noa te mahi a Charles Edmund Sherlock, te kaitā o te Guardian, ki te Ashburton Mail ka nuku ai ki Southbridge. I te 1886 ka riro i a Robert George Park te whakahaeretanga. I roto i ngā tau mahi ko ia tētahi o ngā hoa pakihi ki te umanga. Ka nukuhia e ia te tari o te Guardian ki Leeston. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Te āhua nei ko ngā tau ruarua o muri mai he mea uaua mō te Guardian. Ka whakatārewatia te tānga i ngā tau whakamutunga o ngā 1890, ka riro atu ka riro mai te rangatiratanga. Nō te 1892, nō te whakahokitanga o te nūpepa ki Southbridge e Willliam Zouch, i te Ashburton Guardian i mua, ka haere pai ake ai. Ka tupu te horahanga mai i te 800 tānga ki te 1200. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te 1897 ka tū ko Cecil Rhys Thornton hei etita. He whakapaunga kaha nōna ki te aukati waipiro, ā, nāna te nūpepa i whakamahi hei tautoko i taua take nei. Nā taua whakapaunga kaha ka hāmenetia ia i te 1899 mō te takahi mana mai i āna tuhinga ki te nūpepa. I te 1904 ka nuku atu a Thornton ki te Inangahua Times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nā Horace McMillan, tētahi kairipoata i te nūpepa ka 19 ana tau, nāna te Guardian i hoko i te 1908, ka mau tonu tae noa ki tana rītāitanga i te 1947. I raro i a ia ka pūāwai te nūpepa, ko ia nei tētahi o ngā nūpepa tuawhenua papai ake o te Tōminiona. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ka whakahokia e McMillan ngā whakahaeretanga ki Leeston i te 1916. Ka noho te nūpepa ki reira tae noa ki tōna tuhonotanga ki te Malvern Record ka tū ai te Central Canterbury News i te 1983. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tēnā: e rua noa ngā putanga o te Guardian o mua o te 1891 kei te kitea tonutia i tēnei wā. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Evening Post was founded by Henry Blundell and began publication as a daily in Wellington on 8 February 1865. Blundell was born in Dublin in 1813 and worked for nearly 30 years at the Dublin Evening Mail. In 1860 he migrated with his family to Melbourne. Blundell moved to New Zealand in 1863 and worked on the Otago Daily Times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1864 he founded the Havelock Mail. However the Marlborough goldfields were failing at this time and the Mail only lasted a few months, closing in November the same year. Blundell, business partner David Curle, and Blundell’s two sons, John and Henry, then decided to try their luck in Wellington, which at that time did not have a daily newspaper. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wellington had just become the colony’s capital and the Blundells decided that this, combined with the state of the other newspapers being published in Wellington at the time, made starting a daily newspaper there a sound business proposition. The only rivals to the Post were the tri-weekly Wellington Independent and the New Zealand Advertiser, and the weekly New Zealand Spectator, which was in poor health and closed in August 1865. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was therefore a strong opportunity for a daily paper in Wellington.The Post was a family business, with father Henry being manager and principal leader writer, and sons Henry junior, John and Louis, who joined the firm on completing his schooling in Dunedin, being typesetters, canvassers and reporters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new paper aimed to record every event ‘within a mile of Martin’s fountain’ which lay at the corner of Featherston Street and Lambton Quay. By focussing on local issues, attention to detail and high-quality writing the Post soon established itself as the leading Wellington paper, a position it did not relinquish during its long career. Its editorial policy was politically neutral. Unlike other papers of the time, which were established to publicise a particular political opinion, the Post was not aligned to any political factions and was therefore able to comment freely on political and other matters. As Blundell wrote in the Post’s first edition, ‘a liberal course of policy will be pursued and the bounds of moderation will not be overstepped in giving expression to the views entertained by the proprietors as journalists.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Henry Blundell senior died in 1878 and the paper continued to be run by his sons, with Frank Gifford as editor. Perhaps because it was such a locally focussed paper-Wellington’s paper-the Post was able to outlast it various rivals over the years. The Post’s only serious competition was the Dominion, which began publication in September 1907. The Dominion was founded to be the voice of the conservative element in Wellington politics, and as such was at the opposite end of the political spectrum to the Post. This, combined with the fact that the Dominion was a morning rather than an evening paper, meant that serious competition with the Post was not an issue as each had its own niche in the capital city. The Blundell family retained control of the paper until the late 1960s. The 1970s saw a steady decline in the Post’s circulation and the Dominion, which had been somewhat in the Post’s shadow throughout its career, gradually eclipsed its rival. In 1972 ownership of the Post was combined with the Dominion and in 2002 the Post’s owners decided to close the paper and merge it with the Dominion to create the Dominion Post. The final edition of the Evening Post was published on 6 July 2002, ending what has been called a 137-year love affair with Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Nō te tau 1863 ka neke ia ki Niu Tīreni ka mahi mō te Otago Daily Times. Nāna te Havelock Mail i whakatū i te tau 1864. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heoi, kua tīmata kē te pau haere o ngā koura o Te Wairau i taua wā, ā, kāore noa iho i hipa te wā roa ka kati te nūpepa nei i te marama o Whiringa-ā-rangi o taua tau anō. Kātahi ka taka te whakaaro i a Blundell rātou ko tōna hoa pakihi a David Curle me ngā tama tokorua a Blundell, a John rāua ko Henry, ki te whakatū nūpepa ki Te Whanganui-a-Tara. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I taua wā kāore he nūpepa o ia rā ki taua tāone. Ki tā Blundell titiro, he wā pai mō te whakatū nūpepa ia rā ki Te Whanganui-a-Tara nā te mea, kātahi anō ka tohungia ko Te Whanganui-a-Tara hei tāone matua mō Niu Tīreni, tāpae atu ko te tūpuhi o ngā nūpepa o Te Whanganui-a-Tara i taua wā. E toru anake ngā nūpepa hei whakataetae mā te Evening Post – ko te Wellington Independent, ko te New Zealand Advertiser hoki – e toru wā i te wiki ka puta; ko te New Zealand Spectator – kotahi te wā i te wiki ka puta. Kāore i te pai te haere o te New Zealand Spectator, ā, nō te marama o Here-turi-kōkā o te tau 1865 ka kati. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He umanga te Post nā te whānau Blundell – ko Henry te kaiwhakahaere me te kaitito matua, ko ana tama a Henry te tuarua, a John me Louis ka mahi hei whakarauwaka tuhinga, hei kaikawe pūrongo, hei kaihoko nūpepa hoki. I te otinga rawa o tana kura ki Ōtepoti ka kuhu a Louis ki te nūpepa mahi ai. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko te whāinga o te nūpepa, kia tangohia ngā kōrero katoa ‘within a mile of Martin’s fountain’ [kei roto i te kotahi maero i te puna torotī a Mātene], kei te kokonga o te huarahi o Featherston me Lambton Quay. Mā te hāngai pū ki ngā take o tōna takiwā, te tika o āna kōrero me te koi o ngā tuhinga ka matika te Post hei nūpepa matua o Te Whanganui-a-Tara; kāhore ia ka hinga i tēnei tūranga i roto i ngā tau. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ka noho whakaraupapa i ngā take tōrangapū ngā tuhinga a te Post. Kāore te Post i rite ki ērā o ngā nūpepa o te wā ka whirinaki ki tētahi rōpū tōrangapū; nā reira tareka ai tana whakatakoto kōrero here kore mō ngā take tōrangapū me ētahi atu kaupapa. Nā Blundell tonu te kōrero i takoto ki te nūpepa: ‘ a liberal course of policy will be pursued and the bounds of moderation will not be overstepped in giving expression to the views entertained by the proprietors as journalists’ [Ka whānui te titiro a te nūpepa ki ngā take katoa. Heoi, i a rātou ka mahi hei kaikawe pūrongo, kāhore te hunga nō rātou te nūpepa e takahi i ngā whanonga pai.] Ka mate a Henry Blundell te matua i te tau 1878.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heoi, ka haere tonu te nūpepa i raro i ngā whakahaere o ana tama me Frank Gifford hei ētita. Nā te hāngai pū o te titiro a te Evening Post ki ngā take o Te Whanganui-a-Tara i kaha ai ia i roto i ngā tau, ahakoa te hingahinga o ngā hoa tauwhāinga i te wā. Ko te Dominion anake te nūpepa kaha ki te tauwhāinga ki te Post. Nō te marama o Mahuru o te tau 1907 tīmata ai te Dominion. I whakatūria te Dominion ki te whakaputa i ngā kōrero o te taha matau o te ao tōrangapū ki roto o Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Hei ngā ahiahi o ia rā ka puta; kāore i pērā i te Post hei ngā ata ka puta. Koianei pea ngā take i ora ai, i pakari ai ngā nūpepa e rua nei mō ngā tau maha. Kia tae rā anō ki te tekau tau atu i 1960 ko te whānau Blundell te mana whakahaere i te Post. Hei te tekau tau atu i 1970 ka paheke te Post ka iti haere ngā nūpepa kei te hokona. Ka eke ko te Dominion ki runga ake. I te tau 1972 ka taka ngā nūpepa e rua ki raro i te mana whakahaere kotahi. I te tau 2002 ka whakatau ngā rangatira o te Post me kati taua nūpepa ka hanumi ki te Dominion kia puta ko te Dominion Post. Nō te rā 6 o Hōngongoi o te tau 2002 te putanga whakamutunga o te Post, e 137 tau mai i tōna pueanga.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

In 1879 an issue of the Star covering a tragic fire in Dunedin&amp;rsquo;s Octagon sold 8,300 copies, thought to be a record at that time for a New Zealand newspaper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell retained sole ownership of the Star until he was well into his eighties, when he transferred ownership to his family, beginning a long-standing relationship between Bell&amp;rsquo;s descendants and the Star. Bell was succeeded as editor in 1894 by Mark Cohen, who already had a long association with the Star as a crusading journalist. Under Cohen the Star advocated social reform and was a vigorous supporter of Liberal policy. The Star flourished during Cohen&amp;rsquo;s editorship, and attracted notable contributors such as the Presbyterian minister and social reformer, Rutherford Waddell, who wrote a weekly column for the Star for 27 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Evening Star made a strong contribution to sporting journalism. In 1907 it began issuing a Saturday night sporting edition which evolved into the Star Sports, which for many years was published in tabloid form with distinctive yellow newsprint coversheets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The depression years of the early 1930s curbed plans for expansion and the outbreak of World War II also hindered growth. However, in the post-war period the Star entered an era of expansion much greater than any other in its history. Vic Cavanagh, perhaps better known as coach of Otago&amp;rsquo;s rugby team during their Ranfurly Shield tenure in the 1940s, was general manager from 1950 to 1973 and became an influential voice in the newspaper industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a high point in the early 1960s, when the Evening Star had a circulation of more than 30,000, the Star began to decline; in common with other evening newspapers competition from television was a key factor. In 1975 the Evening Star and Otago Daily Times companies merged to become Allied Press and on 3 November 1979 the Evening Star ceased as daily newspaper. The Star was transformed into a community newspaper and as at 2015 continues to be published in this format.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Fair Play, subtitled "An illustrated journal for sensible men and women", was published in Wellington by the well-known printing firm McKee and Gamble from 1893 to 1894.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although registered as a newspaper, it was more correctly classified as an illustrated serial, focusing on political and cultural topics as well as gossip, sport, light literature and satirical sketches of public figures. It was published weekly from November 1893 to April 1894, and then monthly from May 1894 to November 1894, when it stopped being produced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fair Play aimed to be liberal and unbiased, declaring itself to be "against prohibition of any kind" and free from the "manacles" and "slavish obedience" to political and social interests it saw constraining the rest of the New Zealand press.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the paper billed itself as "an unprejudiced New Zealand weekly" and proudly declared that "Fair Play is a jewel", it was strongly opinionated. Fair Play stated in the first issue that when it came to prominent citizens it intended to "attack [them] honestly and fairly in the lists of public opinion". However this policy may have backfired on the paper's publishers. A successful libel suit brought by Francis Dillon Bell against Fair Play in February 1894 may have damaged it both publicly and financially.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The original editor, WE Hammond, arrived from Australia in June 1893 to take up the position but resigned in April 1894 when it was decided to change from weekly to monthly publication. Arthur McKee, previously the paper's manager and one of its publishers, took over the editorship in May 1894, promising more local content. If the change in format was intended to rejuvenate the paper, it did not succeed and the last issue appeared in November 1894.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason for Fair Play's demise is uncertain. Although the paper was similar to the successful Auckland paper the New Zealand Observer and the later New Zealand Free Lance, it may have been that Fair Play was too opinionated and satirical for its own good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arthur McKee continued to have a successful career, being one of the directors of the well-known Cyclopedia of New Zealand, as well as continuing his partnership in the McKee and Gamble publishing company. WE Hammond took a job with the New Zealand Times and worked in journalism in Auckland before leaving New Zealand in 1900.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Tērā pea nā te whiwhi o Francis Dillon Bell i tana whakarite kupu whakakino ki a Fair Play i Hui-tangaru o te tau 1894 i ngahoro ai tōna tūranga tūmatanui, pūtea hoki.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko te ētita tuatahi, a W. E. Hammond, i tae mai ki Pōneke mai i Ahitereiria i te marama o Pipiri 1893 ki te kawe i taua tūranga, ēngari ka whakawāteahia i Paenga-whāwhā o te tau 1894 i te wā i whakaritea ai kia huri mai i te whakaputanga ā-wiki ki te whakaputanga ā-marama. I riro mā Arthur McKee, te kaiwhakahaere i mua o te nūpepa me tētahi o ana kaiwhakaputa, e kawe te mahi ētita nō te Haratua o te tau 1894. Ko tana kī taurangi, kia puta ake ngā take ā-rohe. Meina i whakaarohia mā tēnei huringa e piki ake ai te āhua o te nūpepa, kīhai i tutuki, ā, i oti te tānga whakamutunga i Whiringa-ā-rangi o te tau 1894.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kāhore i tino mārama te pūtake mō te ngaromanga o Fair Play. Ahakoa te ōrite o te nūpepa nei ki te nūpepa rongonui o ākarana, arā, te New Zealand Observer, ā, i muri mai ko te New Zealand Free Lance, tērā pea nā te āta whakahīhī, whakarōrā anō hoki o te Fair Play i raru ai.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ka piki tonu te mahi whai hua a Arthur McKee, ko ia hoki tētahi o ngā kaiwhakahaere o te Cyclopedia o New Zealand me tana kawe tonu i tana hononga i roto i te kamupene whakaputa pukapuka o McKee and Gamble. I kawea ake e W. E. Hammond tētahi tūranga mō te New Zealand Times, ā, ka mahi tonu ki roto i ngā kōrero ā-nūpepa ki ākarana i mua i tana wehenga atu i Aotearoa nei i te tau 1900.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The conditions were right for a newspaper to set up there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper, initially called the Feilding Guardian, was established by George Capper and David Curle in 1879. In 1882 the paper was sold to George Kirton and Augustus Robert Curtis, who changed the title to the Feilding Star. The paper became a daily in 1893 in response to increasing competition from newspapers in other towns in the area, particularly Palmerston North.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1906 the Star was acquired by its best known owner, Frederick Pirani. Pirani had been a Member of the House of Representatives for Palmerston North from 1893 to 1902. Pirani was a radical Liberal whose combative style often got him embroiled in conflict, most notably with Seddon, the Premier and leader of his party. Consequently Seddon endorsed a rival candidate for Palmerston North for the 1899 election. Despite this Pirani retained his seat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Feilding Star was not Pirani’s first venture into newspaper publishing. He had previously worked as a journalist and owned the Manawatu Standard and Hutt and Petone Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Feilding Star ceased publication in October 1939 citing as the cause a newsprint shortage due to the War.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The Grey River Argus was a rarity amongst New Zealand newspapers in that it was open about its political affiliations. The Argus supported the Labour Movement. For many years the legend, “New Zealand’s pioneer Labor daily” appeared on the masthead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Argus was the first newspaper published in Greymouth, the first issue appearing on 14 November 1865. The publisher, James Kerr (1834-1901), had worked on newspapers in Scotland, Melbourne and Dunedin before coming to Greymouth. He became well known throughout the West Coast through his involvement in local and national politics. He was a close friend of Richard Seddon’s and was a member of the Legislative Council. He remained the principal proprietor of the Argus until his death. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Initially the Argus was published three times a week. In 1871 the paper became a daily. From 1870 to 1907 it published a weekly edition called the Weekly Argus. The Argus survived two fires and several floods in its first few years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Argus was fortunate to have several very capable editors in the nineteenth century. These were William Henry Harrison (1831-1879) and Florence Romuald McCarthy (1834-1914). Harrison was editor from 1868 to 1879 and McCarthy from 1880 to 1914. They earned the Argus a national reputation for the quality of its journalism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kerr’s son James became manager of the paper after his father’s death and in 1906 formed the Grey River Argus Company. In 1912 the other daily newspaper in Greymouth, the Greymouth Evening Star, considered buying a controlling share in the paper but decided that the price was too high. The next year the Federation of Labour began negotiating with the owners to buy the paper. Most of the New Zealand press were unsympathetic, often hostile, towards Labour. The Federation thought that they needed a paper of their own to counteract this. Buying the Argus made sense given the strong support that Labour enjoyed on the West Coast. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Negotiations were protracted and it wasn’t till 1919 that the West Coast trade unions acquired the paper. However the Argus was, in effect, already a Labour paper by the time it was sold. In 1918 the paper allowed the Grey Labour Representation Committee to use its columns to support Harry Holland contest the Grey seat in that year's election. Future Prime Minister Peter Fraser was responsible for the Labour campaign on the West Coast and wrote editorials for the Argus during this time. The Argus was considered to have contributed to the election of Labour candidates in 1918 for the seats of Grey and Buller. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The early years of the Argus under union management were difficult. The cost of newsprint was high, advertisers were reluctant to use a Labour paper and a few months after assuming control, fire destroyed the Argus office and plant. This was quickly rebuilt by volunteers. The Hokitika Guardian printed the Argus during this time, ensuring that publication was maintained. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Argus had one rival, the Greymouth Evening Star. The Star began publishing in March 1866. The two papers frequently attacked each other. The Star editorials referred to the Argus as “Labour-Socialists” and the Argus called the Star “Tory-Nationalists”. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1966 the Grey River Argus Company was taken over by Buller Westland Publishing Company and the paper was relaunched in February of that year with the new title of the Argus Leader. The Labour affiliation was toned down. “New Zealand’s pioneer Labor daily” was dropped from the front page. These changes failed to save the Argus and it closed in November. The following notice appeared on the front page of the last issue, “Last evening, the directors of the Buller Westland Publishing Co. Ltd., decided that the “Argus Leader” would cease publication with this morning’s issue.”&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; He rerekē tā Grey River Argus, ki tāna whakapuakitanga i ōna pānga tōrangapū. He tautoko tāna i te Kaupapa Reipa. Huri kau ngā tau, kei tōna uwhi te tohu, “Ko ia nei te nūpepa tuatahi mō Reipa”. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko te Argus te nūpepa tuatahi kia tāngia mai i Greymouth, ko tōna tānga tuatahi ka puta mai i te 14 o Whiringa-ā-rangi 1865. Ko tōna kaiwhakaputa, ko James Kerr (1834-1901), he kaimahi nūpepa i Kotirangi, i Poipiripi me Otepoti i mua i tana haerenga mai ki Greymouth. He rongonui huri noa te Tai Hauāuru mai i ana pānga ki te tōrangapū ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki. He hoa piritata nō Richard Seddon, he mema hoki o te Kaunihera Ā-Ture. Ko ia te rangatira mātāmua o te Argus tae noa ki tōna matenga. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tuatahi, ka toru ngā tānga o te Argus ia wiki. Nō te 1871 ka tāngia ai ia rā. Mai i te 1870 ki te 1907 he whakaputanga ā-wiki, ko te Weekly Argus. I ngā tau tīmatanga i ora mai te Argus ahakoa ngā muranga e rua ki te ahi, me ētahi waipukenga maha hoki. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He waimarie te Argus i ngā pukenga o ōna etita i te rautau tekau mā iwa. Ko ēnei ko William Henry Harrison (1831-1879) me Florence Romuald McCarthy (1834-1914). Ko Harrison te etita mai i te 1868 ki te 1879, ko McCarthy mai i te 1880 ki te 1914. Nā rāua rā anō i nui ai te mana o te Argus i te motu mō te kounga o ana pūrongo ā-nūpepa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te matenga o Kerr ko tāna tama a James hei kaiwhakahaere o te nūpepa ā, nō te 1906 nāna te Grey River Argus Company i whakatū. I te 1912 ka whakaarohia e te Greymouth Evening Star, tērā atu o ngā nūpepa o reira, te hoko hea nui ake o te nūpepa, ēngari he nui rawa nō te utu. No te tau o muri mai ka whakarite te Federation of Labour ki te hoko i te nūpepa mai i ana rangatira. Ko te nuinga o ngā pāpāho o Aotearoa kāore i te rata mai, i ētahi wā he kaikiri, ki a Reipa. Ko tāna he hoko nūpepa mōna ake hei karo i ēnei tūāhua. He tau te hoko i te Argus nā te kaha o te tautoko i a Reipa i te Tai Hauāuru. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ka takaroa ngā whakaritenga tae noa ki te 1919 ka riro ai te nūpepa i ngā ūniana o te Tai Hauāuru. Heoi anō kua tau kē te Argus hei nūpepa mō Reipa i te wā i hokongia ai. I te 1918 ka tukua e te nūpepa te whakamahi a te Grey Labour Representation Committee i ōna pae hei tautoko i a Harry Holland mō te tūru o Grey i ngā pōti o taua tau. Nā Peter Fraser, Pirimia o muri mai, te whakahau mō Reipa i te Tai Hauāuru, me ētahi o ngā tuhinga a te etita o te Argus i taua wā. E whakaponotia ana he pānga nui a te Argus ki te pōtitanga o ngā māngai o Reipa i te 1918 mō ngā tūru o Grey me Buller. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko ngā tau moata o te Argus i raro i ngā ūniana he uaua. He nui te utu o te pepa tā, he whakahoihoi nō ngā kaiutu pānui ki te whai i te pepa Reipa ā, kāore i roa o muri mai i te rironga o te mana whakahaere, ka turakina te tari me te wheketere o te Argus ki te ahi. Ka tere whakahoungia e te hunga tūao. Nā te Hokitika Guardian te Argus i tāngia i tēnei wā ka puta tonu mai ai. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kotahi tonu te hoa tauwhāinga o te Argus ko te Greymouth Evening Star. Nō te Paengawhāwhā o te 1866 ka tīmata ai te puta o te Star. Taukumekume ai ngā pepa e rua nei. Ko tā te Star mō te Argus he “Labour-Socialists” ko tā te Argus mō te Star he “Tory-Nationalists”. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te 1966 ka riro te Grey River Argus Company i te Buller Westland Publishing Company, ka māunu anō ai te nūpepa i te Huitanguru o taua tau nei me tōna ingoa hōu, te Argus Leader. Ka whakangāwarihia te pānga ki a Reipa. Ka kore te “Ko ia nei te nūpepa tuatahi mō Reipa” mai i te uwhi. Kāore te Argus i ora mai i ēnei whakarerekētanga ka katia ai i te Whiringa-ā-rangi. Ko ia nei te pānui i te uwhi o te putanga whakamutunga, “Nō tērā ahiahi ka whakatauria ai e ngā rangatira o te Buller Westland Publishing Co.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Hastings’s first regular newspaper was the Hastings Star, which appeared in 1886 but only lasted for two years. Despite having a population of around 2,000 by 1890, another newspaper did not emerge until the Hastings Standard appeared in 1896. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Standard was started by William Arnott and Anthony Cashion, who were both from Greymouth. The Standard was embroiled in an early dispute with the United Press Association over what it saw as the charging of an exorbitant fee to join the Association. The owner of the neighbouring Napier newspaper the Daily Telegraph, Edward Knowles, was also at the time Chairman of the Association and allegations were made that he had used his position to prevent the successful establishment of a potential rival. A lower fee was eventually agreed, but the Standard’s early years were blighted by financial difficulties. At one stage, after staff were not paid for six weeks, continued publication was only ensured after subscribers and advertisers rallied to provide the necessary funds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After various changes of ownership, in 1907 William Whitlock, who had previously published the Egmont Settler in Stratford, acquired the Standard along with a business partner. Three generations of the Whitlock family were subsequently involved in the running of the Standard and its successors and were instrumental in turning it into one of the country’s leading provincial dailies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1910 Whitlock accepted an offer from a consortium backed by local farming interests to incorporate the Standard into a new venture, the Hawke’s Bay Tribune. The first issue of the new title was published on 12 December 1910 and a period of expansion and technological development began. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The 1931 Hawke’s Bay earthquake dealt a severe blow to both Hastings and the Tribune. The newspaper’s office was severely damaged and production ceased for close to two weeks, although small daily bulletins were issued by the Tribune. Tribune reporter A L ‘Darby’ Ryan was killed when the clock tower of the Hastings Post Office collapsed on him; reportedly, when his body was recovered from the rubble, a pencil and pad were in his hands and his pocket contained ‘copy’ collected during his morning round. The printing plant of the Napier morning newspaper, the Hawke’s Bay Herald, was completely destroyed by the earthquake and the Tribune took over printing of the Herald. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The earthquake and the Depression years took a heavy toll on the Herald and in 1937 it was merged with the Tribune. The new paper was called the Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune and its first issue appeared on 16 January 1937. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1982 ownership of the Hawke’s Bay Herald-Tribune and its long-time rival, the Daily Telegraph of Napier, was amalgamated. The two newspapers continued to be published separately, but in 1999 they were merged to become Hawke’s Bay Today. With a history that stretches back to the publication of the first issue of the Hawke’s Bay Herald in 1857, Hawke’s Bay Today is the third oldest newspaper currently being published in New Zealand, as of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Sir Donald McLean first proposed a Hawke's Bay newspaper to advocate for provincial separation from Wellington. McLean was one of the first settlers of the fledgling district of Ahuriri, as it was called at the time. Another settler, James Wood, took up the challenge and published the first issue of the Hawke's Bay Herald and Ahuriri Advocate in Napier on 24 September 1857.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The campaigning for separation was successful and Hawke's Bay became a separate province in 1858. Wood became the official provincial government printer and the Herald also served as the medium for government notices. The "Ahuriri Advocate" part of the paper's title was dropped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After first being published weekly, the paper became bi-weekly in 1861. It became a daily in 1871 when Wood sold out to four employees, including William Carlile who had been appointed editor in 1870.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hawke's Bay Weekly Courier was a weekly offshoot of the Herald. It was established in 1879 and lasted until 1897. Both papers survived a disastrous fire that destroyed the Herald offices in 1886.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A larger newspaper was produced after new machinery was installed in 1926. The Herald strongly advocated for the region's advancement and promoted projects including the Wellington-Napier railway and the construction of water and sewerage systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The February 1931 Napier earthquake spelt the end of the Herald as a separate entity. The quake and subsequent fires completely destroyed the printing plant. The Hastings newspaper, the Hawke's Bay Tribune, took over printing the Herald. In January 1937 the papers merged to form the Hawke's Bay Herald-Tribune, with the last issue of the Herald published on 16 January 1937.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1999 the Hawke's Bay Herald-Tribune was merged with the long-established Napier paper, the Daily Telegraph, to become Hawke's Bay Today.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

It was published weekly as a summary of the stories in the Hawke's Bay Times in the previous week.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Hawke's Bay Weekly Times was the weekly edition of the Hawke's Bay Times, and started on 6 Feb 1865. It contained a summary of the previous week's stories in the Hawke's Bay Times and was intended as a cheap alternative to the daily paper for people living in the isolated rural areas of Hawke's Bay. The paper was published on a Monday costing six pence compared with the Times, which was published three times a week at three pence an issue, therefore saving three pence for subscribers to the weekly edition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hawke's Bay Times was first published in 1861 by Yates Brothers Printers. They sold the paper to Thomas Bennick Harding in 1865. It is possible that the weekly edition was part of the new regime under Harding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Little is known of the Hawke's Bay Times' editorial stance but it appears to have struggled against two other papers, the Hawke's Bay Herald and the Daily Telegraph. The Hawke's Bay Herald had been running since 1857 and was the mouthpiece of the landowners while the Daily Telegraph, which began in 1871, represented the region's commercial interests. It seems the Hawke's Bay Times was unable to compete against these two powerful and competing papers, and stopped publishing in 1874.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hawke's Bay Weekly Times had already stopped publication in December 1868 without explanation. It may have been due to poor sales combined with an economic depression that struck the region between 1867 and 1868.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Daily Telegraph had also attempted to produce a weekly edition. However this paper, the Weekly Mercury and Hawke's Bay Advertiser (first published in 1875) also failed due to poor sales and stopped production in 1882.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Tērā pea ko te putanga ā-wiki nā ngā rangatira hōu ki raro i a Harding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kāore te kaupapa o te ētita o te Hawke's Bay Times i te āta mōhiotia, heoi anō te āhua nei he uaua tāna tauwhāinga ki te Hawke's Bay Herald me te Daily Telegraph. Mai te tau 1857 te rerenga o te Hawke's Bay Herald hei māngai mō ngā kaipupuri whenua, ēngari ia te Daily Telegraph, nō te tau 1871 tōna tīmatanga, i noho māngai mō ngā pakihi o te rohe.

In Shannon in 1893, William C Nation, well-known in spiritualist circles, began the tri-weekly Manawatu Farmer and Horowhenua County Chronicle, with his son Charles. Nation had previously worked for the Nelson Colonist and the New Zealand Times and had owned the Wairarapa Standard. In 1896 the well-known newspaper ‘planter’ Joseph Ivess arrived in nearby Levin and began the Manawatu Express and Horowhenua County Advertiser, selling it almost immediately to William J Reid and John McKellop. The Nations responded by moving their plant to Levin, buying in turn the Manawatu Express from Reid and McKellop and absorbing it into the Manawatu Farmer, which continued as a tri-weekly as the town grew.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

The Nations responded by moving their plant to Levin, buying in turn the Manawatu Express from Reid and McKellop and absorbing it into the Manawatu Farmer, which continued as a tri-weekly as the town grew. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1908 David S Papworth began the short-lived bi-weekly, the Levin Times. This did not survive and Papworth was then briefly manager, editor and reporter of the Manawatu Farmer. In October the same year the Evening Post reported the court case in which Papworth claimed £500 damages (about $34,000 today) from the Horowhenua Publishing Company for wrongful dismissal. The company claimed ‘disloyalty, negligence, and incompetency’; the judge, in awarding £225 to Papworth, suggested the jury might have reasonably taken the view that ‘the company was anxious to sell the property and to get rid of the defendant for the purpose of facilitating the sale’. Ironically, it was Papworth, possibly using some of the money awarded him, who bought the Manawatu Farmer. In 1909, he renamed it the Horowhenua Daily Chronicle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Herbert G Kerslake and Robert H Billens were the next owners, buying the paper in 1917. With wartime paper shortages, it was published tri-weekly as the Levin Chronicle until daily publication was resumed in 1923. Before Levin was connected to electricity in 1924 the paper’s printing presses and linotypes were water-powered. The waste waster was piped out to the street gutter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1944, L A Humphrey, who began his newspaper career as a Chronicle paper boy in 1920, became a director of what was now Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey. Over the years the Daily Chronicle consolidated its position in Levin and Horowhenua, as the town’s population grew strongly from the 1940s to the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey became, in 1960, part of the United Publishing and Printing Company (UPP), headed by the Rotorua Post’s Ray Smith. Wilson &amp; Horton acquired all the shares in UPP in 1985. A decade later Wilson &amp; Horton, in response to a share raid by Brierley Investments, welcomed the Irish media company Independent Newspapers Plc (INP) as a major shareholder. INP quickly gained control and by April 1998 wholly owned Wilson &amp; Horton. In 2001, INP sold its shareholding to APN News and Media, an Australian media company it partly owned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In early 2007 the Daily Chronicle switched from broadsheet to tabloid format and, interestingly, given subsequent developments, won the 2007 PANPA (Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers’ Association) Newspaper of the Year Award for newspapers of under 15,000 circulation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The next year APN announced that the Chronicle was ending six days a week publication and would be distributed free to every household in Levin and surrounding districts, on Wednesday and Saturdays. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Ko te urupare a ngā Nation ko te nuku i tō rātou wheketere ki Taitoko (Levin), me te hoko i te Manawatu Express mai i a Reid rāua ko McKellop, ka tīmataria e rātou te Manawatu Farmer e toru ōna putanga ia wiki i te wā e tupu tonu ana te tāone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I 1908 ka tīmataria e Davis S Papworth tētahi putanga rua wiki, ko te Levin Times. Kāore i roa ka katia te whakaputanga o tērā, ā, ka riro i a Papworth ngā tūranga o te kaiwhakahaere, te ētita, me te kaipūrongo o te Manawatu Farmer. I te marama o Oketopa o taua tau tonu, i puta te pūrongo i te Evening Post mō tētahi kēhi kōti, arā, ko te whai a Papworth i te utunga £500 (āhua $34,000 i ēnei rā) mai i te Horowhenua Publishing Company ko te pananga hē te take. E ai ki te kamupene, ‘he kōtua, he whakahapa, he koretake hoki’; i te tukuhanga o te £225 ki a Papworth, i puta te huatau a te kaiwhakawā ki te tekau mā rua, tērā pea ko te hiahia a te kamupene ko te hoko i te rawa, me te pana i a Papworth mō te hoko rawa anō te take. Ko te mea korokē, nā Papworth, i runga pea i te moni ka whakawhiwhia ki a ia, i hoko te Manawatu Farmer i 1909 ka hurihia hoki te ingoa ki te Horowhenua Daily Chronicle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko ngā kaipupuri i muri i a ia, ko Herbert G Kerslake rāua ko Robert H Billens, ka hokona e rāua te pepa i 1917. Nā runga i te korekore o te pepa i waenganui i ngā tau o te pakanga, e toru noa ngā whakaputanga i whakaputaina ia wiki, ko te Levin Chronicle te ingoa tae atu ki 1923 ko te tau tērā i tīmata anō te whakaputa ā-rā. I mua i te tūhononga o Levin ki te hiko i 1924, nā te wai te kaha whakahaere i ngā perehi tā me ngā perehi pato raina (linotype) o te niupepa. I makina noa te wai para ki te kōrere i te tiriti. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1944 ka riro i a L A Humphrey te tūranga o te kaiwhakahaere matua o Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey, nāna i tīmata tana mahi niupepa hei tama pepa mō te Chronicle i te tau 1920. Ka taka ngā tau, ka whakamārōtia e te Daily Chronicle tōna tūranga i Taitoko me te Horowhenua, i te wā e piki kaha haere ana te taupori o te tāone i ngā tau mai i 1940 ki ngā tau o ngā 1960. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I 1960 ka whakaurua atu a Kerslake, Billens and Humphrey ki te United Publishing and Printing Company (UPP), ko te kaiwhakahaere ko Ray Smith o te Rotorua Post. I 1985 ka riro i a Wilson &amp; Horton ngā hea katoa o UPP. Tekau tau i muri mai hei urupare i te hokonga o ngā hea maha e Brierley Investments, ka whakatauria tētahi kamupene pāpāho Airihi ko Independent Newspapers Plc (INP) hei kaipupuri hea matua. Kāore e roa ka riro i a INP te mana whakahaere, ā, hei te marama o Āpereira 1998 ka riro katoa a Wilson &amp; Horton i a rātou. I te tau 2001 ka hokona atu e INP ō rātou hea ki a APN News and Media, he kamupene pāpāho, ko rātou tētahi o ana kaipupuri. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tīmatanga o 2007 i huri te Daily Chronicle mai i te hōputu rau whānui ki te hōputu hīnohi, ā, he mīharo hoki i runga i ngā whanaketanga o muri mai ka riro i te niupepa te Tohu 2007 PANPA (Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers’ Association) Newspaper of the Year mō ngā niupepa i raro i te 15,000 te tohatohanga. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Te tau i muri mai ka puta te kōrero ka whakamutua te whakaputanga o te Chronicle e APN i ngā rā e ono o te wiki, ka tukuna kore utu kē ki ngā whare katoa o Taitoko, huri noa hoki i te rohe, i ngā Wenerei me ngā Rāhoroi. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; In early June 1885 the New Zealand Herald’s Rotorua correspondent wrote: ‘The first copy of our local paper, appropriately styled the Hot Lakes Chronicle, will probably be issued on Saturday first [6 June], as a weekly production. The proprietor, Mr Lechuer, says he has met with every encouragement and is sanguine of its success.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Little is known about the original owner of Rotorua’s first newspaper, but the first months of publication were not without drama. In November the New Zealand Herald ran this item: ‘On behalf of the Hot Lakes Chronicle, a notice was posted at Ohinemutu stating that the paper will not be printed this morning, nor probably for a week, as the printer is drunk.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; An early part-owner, Peter A Crawford, was later proprietor and editor of the Opotiki Herald from 1903 until his death in 1928. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Francis F Watt from Montrose in Scotland, the son of the owner of several Glasgow newspapers, spent time in Australia and America before arriving in Rotorua in 1895 and purchasing an interest in the Hot Lakes Chronicle. He was sole owner when he died in 1900, his wife continuing to run the paper for a period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Auckland Provincial District) noted: ‘During the tourist season of 1901 it was published as a bi-weekly, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but reverted to the Saturday issue for the winter months. It is double demy, and has eight columns of reading matter, apart from advertisements. The paper is now edited and the business conducted by Mr. Watt's widow, who has a jobbing plant and does the local printing trade, besides carrying on the business of general stationer and news agent.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; David Gardner, also a Scotsman, owned the Hot Lakes Chronicle from 1902 to his death in 1918. Two years earlier he merged the Hot Lakes Chronicle and the Rotorua Times which had begun as the bi-weekly Wonderland Gazette and Rotorua Times in 1906 and had been a daily since 1910. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; R A Gardner managed the merged evening daily, now the Rotorua Chronicle, after his father’s death. Oswald Walter Exall edited the newspaper from 1918 until his death in 1925; he was followed by C H Worthington until 1931. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1931, the Rotorua and Bay of Plenty Publishing Company paid £10,000 (just over $1 million today) for the Rotorua Chronicle, changed publication to mornings, and renamed the paper the Rotorua Morning Post. First editor of the renamed paper was, albeit briefly, Lyonel George Ashton. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; E G Webber was editor from 1932 until 1940. He spent the next five years as editor of the NZEF Times and as a war correspondent and had a distinguished post-war newspaper career. In 1947, when H Lawson Smith, previously a reporter on the Otago Daily Times and Manawatu Standard, was editor, the paper changed back to evening publication as the Rotorua Post. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1953 it was one of the first New Zealand newspapers to carry front page news. As of 2014, the Rotorua Post was a morning daily owned by the APN Group. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; I ngā rā tuatahi o te marama o Hune 1885 ka tuhia e te kaituhi a te New Zealand Herald mō Rotorua : ‘Tērā pea ka whakaputaina te kape tuatahi o te Hot Lakes Chronicle, tā tātou nūpepa ā-rohe tika tonu te ingoa, hei te Hatarei tuatahi [6 Hune], hei nūpepa ā-wiki. E ai ki tōna rangatira ki a te Lechuer, he tini ngā kupu whakamihi mai a te tangata mō te nūpepa hou, ā, kotahi anō te whakaaro, ka tupu ki tōna tino ora.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He iti noa ngā kōrero toitū mō te rangatira tuatahi o te nūpepa tuatahi o Rotorua, engari i āhua whakapukepuke te moana i ōna hoenga tuatahi ki te ao. I te marama o Nōema ka whakaputaina e te New Zealand Herald tēnei kōrero: ‘Hei kupu whakamārama mō te Hot Lakes Chronicle, i whakaputaina he pānui ki Ōhinemutu kāore te nūpepa e puta i tēnei ata, otirā, mō te wiki tonu atu, nā te mea kei te haurangi te kaitā.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko tētahi o ngā rangatira mō tētahi wāhi o ōna hea i ngā rā tuatahi ko Peter A Crawford. He rangatira, he ētita hoki ia i ngā tau o muri mai mō te Opotiki Herald mai i 1903 taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1928. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I peka atu a Francis F Watt, nō Montrose i Kotirani te tama o te rangatira o ētahi nūpepa i Glasgow, ki Ahitereiria me Amerika i mua i tana taenga mai ki Rotorua i te tau 1895 ā, ka hokona e ia ētahi hea i te Hot Lakes Chronicle. Koia te rangatira tū takitahi i tōna matenga i te tau 1900, ā, nā tana wahine i whakahaere te nūpepa mō tētahi wā. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; E ai ki te Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Auckland Provincial District): ‘I roto i ngā marama tāpoi o te tau 1901 e rua ōna putanga i te wiki, arā, i ngā Wenerei me ngā Rāhoroi, engari ka hoki anō ki te putanga i te rāhoroi i ngā marama o te hōtoke. He double demy te rahi, ā, e waru ōna tīwae pūrākau hei pānui, hāunga anō ngā whakatairanga. Kei te ētitatia, kei te whakahaeretia hoki te umanga i ēnei rā e te pouaru a Watt, he wheketere mahi tāna, ā, koia kei te kawe i ngā mahi tā a te rohe, i tua atu i te kawe i te tūnga hoko pepa, hoko pukapuka, nūpepa hoki.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nā David Gardner, he Kotimana hoki, i pupuru te Hot Lakes Chronicle mai i 1902 taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1918. E rua tau i mua atu i haumitia e ia te Hot Lakes Chronicle me teRotorua Times, te nūpepa i tīmata ai heiWonderland Gazette and Rotorua Times, he nūpepa e rua ōna putanga i te wiki, i te tau 1906, ā, he nūpepa ā-rā mai i te tau 1910. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ka whakahaeretia e R A Gardner te nūpepa haumi ā-rā, i kīa ai ko te Rotorua Chronicle, i muri i te matenga o tana pāpā. Nā Oswald Walter Exall te nūpepa i ētita mai i 1918 taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1925; ā, ka whāia mai ia e C H Worthington tae noa mai ki te tau 1931. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1931ka utua e te Rotorua and Bay of Plenty Publishing Company tētahi £10,000 (neke tata atu i te $1 miriona i ngā moni o ēnei rā) mō te Rotorua Chronicle, ā, ka hurihia te putanga o te nūpepa ki ngā ata, me te whakaingoa anō i a ia ki te Rotorua Morning Post. Ko te ingoa o te ētita o te nūpepa ingoa hou, mō te wā poto ko Lyonel George Ashton. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I noho a E G Webber hei ētita mai i 1932 taea noatia te tau 1940. I pau i a ia ngā tau e rima hei ētita mō te NZEF Times, hei kaituhi mō te pakanga hoki, ā, he maha āna mahi nui i muri mai i te pakanga i te ao nūpepa. I te tau 1947, i te pikinga mai a H Lawson Smith hei ētita, he kaituhi ia i te Otago Daily Times me te Manawatu Standard i mua, ka whakahokia anō te nūpepa hei nūpepa ā-ahiahi, ko te ingoa ko te Rotorua Post. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1953 koia tētahi o ngā nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa kia whakaputaina ngā rongo o te wā i tōna whārangi o waho. I te tau 2014, i purutia te Rotorua Post hei nūpepa ā-ata ka puta ia rā, e te APN Group. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The neighbouring borough of Petone had managed to sustain a newspaper, the Hutt and Petone Chronicle, since 1887. By the 1920s Lower Hutt’s population was approaching that of Petone’s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Hutt News was first issued in April 1927 under the auspices of the local Businessmen’s Association with 2500 copies posted to households and businesses in Lower Hutt. In 1928 Smith was joined by James and William Kerr from the Petone Chronicle. Together they formed the Hutt Printing and Publishing Company to produce a new version of the Hutt News. Smith remained as manager with William Kerr assisting him while his brother stayed with the Chronicle. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Kerr family had long been involved with newspapers. The father, James Kerr (1834-1901), had worked on papers in Scotland, Australia and Otago before establishing the Grey River Argus in Greymouth in 1865. James, his son, managed the Argus before buying the Petone Chronicle in 1912. William had worked on the Argus and the New Zealand Times. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The paper thrived as the population of the area grew rapidly in the 1940s and 1950s although production was threatened during the War due to staff shortages. The Hutt News had to rely on printers from the Trentham Military Camp to keep the paper going. In 1948 William Kerr became the Managing Director after the death of Walter Smith. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1953 the Hutt Printing and Publishing Company took over the Petone Chronicle and continued to publish that paper until 1967. In 1961 William Kerr died and his son Ted succeeded him as Managing Director. In 1963 the paper was sold to Blundell Brothers, publishers of the Evening Post. The Hutt News became part of Independent Newspapers Limited (INL) in 1972 after they bought the Blundell’s company. Ownership changed again in 2003 when Fairfax bought INL. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

Nō te taenga ki te tekau tau mai i 1920 kua tata atu te taupori o Lower Hutt ki tō Pitoone. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I puta te Hutt News tuatahi i te marama o Āperira 1927 i raro i te maru o te rōpū o te Businessmen’s Association o te takiwā, ā, i tukuna ētahi kape 2500 ki ngā kāinga me ngā umanga katoa o Lower Hutt. Nō te tau 1928 ka uru mai a James rāua ko William Kerr mai i te Petone Chronicle hei hoa mō Smith. I mahi tahi rātou ki te whakatū i te Hutt Printing and Publishing Company ā, ka puta i a ia tētahi putanga hōu o te Hutt News. Ka noho tonu a Smith hei kaiwhakahaere, ko William Kerr te kaiāwhina i a ia, ā, ka noho tonu tana tuakana i te Chronicle. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He roa tonu te mahi a te whānau Kerr i te ao niupepa.

Nā tana tama, ko James hoki tana ingoa, i whakahaere te Argus i mua i tana hoko i te Petone Chronicle i 1912.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Hawera &amp; Normanby Star was founded in 1880 by Patrick Galvin, Joseph Innes and J.C. Yorke. Southern Taranaki was being opened up at this time and they saw an opportunity to establish a paper there. All three had worked together on the New Zealand Times in Wellington and their partnership was forged there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first issue appeared on 10 April 1880 and the paper was published twice a week. In 1881 Galvin retired due to ill health and his place was taken by Joseph Armit. However Galvin continued to be involved with newspapers for the rest of his life, founding the short-lived Hawera Morning Post in 1894 and contributing to the New Zealand Times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Star saw off a challenge early on from Joseph Ivess, publisher of the nearby Patea Mail. Ivess had been publishing the Patea Mail since 1875 and had ambitions to establish a chain of papers in Taranaki. He tried to persuade Galvin not to set up in Hawera. When Galvin persisted, he opened an office in Hawera, from which he briefly published the Hawera Times. However the residents of Hawera preferred the Star and Ivess abandoned his new paper after two issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Star progressed steadily in its first two decades. In 1882 a new press was installed and the paper began daily publication. In 1885 it started the Egmont Star, a weekly compendium of items from the parent paper for distribution to the backblocks of Taranaki. The Egmont Star ceased in 1914. In 1895 the Hawera Star survived a fire that destroyed the paper's premises and plant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1889 Yorke became sole proprietor; in 1893 he sold the Star to the paper's editor, William Alfred Parkinson. Parkinson ran the paper until his death in 1920. Ownership changed several more times through the 20th century. The paper ceased daily publication in 1977 and became a community paper the following year. It is still published in that form today.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I te tau 1881 ka whakatāngia a Galvin nā tana pāngia e te mate, ā, ka riro tōna tūranga i a Joseph Armit. Engari i noho tonu a Galvin ki roto i ngā whakarite o ngā nūpepa mō te roanga atu o tōna oranga, ā, nāna i tīmata te nūpepa Hāwera Morning Post i te tau 1894, ahakoa poto noa iho te wā ki tēnei pepa, me te whai wāhi anō ki te New Zealand Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tīmatanga i parea atu e te Star te wero a Joseph Ivess, te kaitā i te nūpepa tata mai, te Patea Mail. E tāhia ana e Ivess te Patea Mail i te tau 1875 me tana hiahia ki te whakatū i ētahi nūpepa ki roto o Taranaki. I whakamātau ia ki te aukati i a Galvin mai i Hāwera. Nā te ngana haere tonu o Galvin, ka whakatūhia e ia he tari ki Hāwera, i reira ka tāhia te Hāwera Times mō te wā poto. Engari i hiahia kē ngā tāngata o Hāwera ki te Star, ā, e rua ngā putanga o tēnei nūpepa ka mutu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pai tonu te haere o te Star i ngā tau rua tekau mai i tōna tīmatanga. I te tau 1882 ka whakauruhia he mīhini tā hou, ā, ka tāhia te nūpepa nei ia rangi. I te tau 1885 ka tīmatahia te Egmont Star, ā, puta ai tēnei nūpepa ia wiki me ngā pitopito kōrero mai i te nūpepa matua hei tohatoha atu ki ngā wāhi tuawhenua o Taranaki. I katia te Egmont Star i te tau 1914. I te tau 1895 i ora noa te Hawera Star i tētahi kāpura i turakina ai te wāhi me ngā rawa o te nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1889 ka noho ko Yorke te rangatira ake; i te tau 1893 ka hokona atu e ia te Star ki tōna kaietita, a William Alfred Parkinson. Whakahaerehia e Parkinson te pepa nei tae noa ki tōna matenga i te tau 1920. He maha tonu ngā whakawhititanga o te pepa nei i roto i ngā tau o te rautau 20. Whakamutuhia te tānga ia rangi o tēnei nūpepa i te tau 1977, ā, ka huri hei pepa hapori i te tau o muri mai. Tāhia tonutia hei pepa hapori i ēnei rā.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

No copies of the latter paper have been seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Māori school committees were encouraged to collect money to purchase copies of Te Hoa Maori for children to discuss in Sunday School (Te Korimako ibid).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Te Hoa Maori (The Maori Friend) changed its title in January 1888 to Te Hoa Maori with Good News for All and in January 1894 to Te Hoa Maori and Good News.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contents include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;scriptural tracts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;articles mostly concerning the salvation of mankind through Christ in different parts of the world&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;moral tales with explanations.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For further information, see P Parkinson and P Griffith, Books in Māori (Auckland: Reed, 2004), S28, pp.791-793.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Library would like to thank Gail Dallimore for providing information used in essays about Maori newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Patara Te Tuhi was also a master carver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1857 two Waikato chiefs, Wiremu Toetoe Tumohe of Rangiaowhia and Te Hemara Te Rerehau Paraone of Ngati Maniapoto, went to Austria on board the frigate Novara. From their account published in Te Ao Hou (October 1958: 42-43) it appears likely that they went to Vienna with the express purpose of learning the art of printing. The Emperor of Austria presented them with a &amp;lsquo;printing press and types&amp;rsquo; (ibid. ) which they brought back to Mangere, New Zealand, where Potatau, the first Maori King, resided. The press was used to print the Maori King&amp;#39;s proclamations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The very first documents were single-paged letters by Tamati Ngapora and Te Hira Te Kawau notifying people of the deaths of Kahukoti and Wi Koihoho. Tamati Ngapora&amp;#39;s letter was published on 2 September 1861 and Te Hira Te Kawau&amp;#39;s on 21 September 1861. They both bear the imprint, &amp;lsquo;Mangere. I taia tenei ki te Hokioi o Nui Tireni&amp;rsquo; (This was printed at Mangere at Te Hokioi of New Zealand).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Maori King shifted to Ngaruawahia the press went too, and in 1862 the four page-long newspaper Te Hokioi was published. Te Hokioi was a spirit bird of ancient times. It was never seen but its cry was known as an omen of war or disaster (Gorst, 1864: 336).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Kote perehi kua tae mai ki Ngarua-Wahia ka puta i a ia nga Nui-pepa...ko te pai o tenei perehi hei kawe i a tatou whakaro, ki nga iwi o te Ao; no te mea hoki e takoto maro tonu ana nga kupu o te timatanga ko te whakapono, ko te aroha; ko te ture&amp;rsquo; (15 June 1862: 1) (The press has arrived at Ngaruawahia, and newspapers are being produced from it...this press is ideal for carrying our thoughts abroad for it was founded on the words: faith, love and law). These words come from Potatau&amp;#39;s saying, &amp;lsquo;Heoi ano taku, ko te whakapono, ko te aroha, ko te ture. I have nothing, or mean nothing, or wish nothing, but Faith, Love and the Law&amp;rsquo; (Buddle, 1860: 23).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newspaper ceased publication with the outbreak of the Land Wars between the government and Waikato people; the last issue was printed on 21 May, 1863.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1922 Alexander McDonnell, a fluent Maori speaker and former militia captain who fought against Waikato during the Land Wars, reprinted Te Hokioi on &amp;lsquo;the Free Press Printing Works&amp;rsquo; in Auckland. The format, capitalisation and arrangement of this reprint are quite different from the original, and several of the letters are not reprinted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For further information about the newspaper, see P Parkinson and P Griffith, Books in Maori (Auckland: Reed, 2004), S13, pp. 758&amp;ndash;760.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cowan, James.

McCurdy was a significant figure in the development of Upper Hutt, both socially and politically. To him can be attributed the first Town Board in 1907, the first cinema, the debate for gas lighting within Upper Hutt and the first newspaper, the Hutt Valley Independent. McCurdy went on to become the first Mayor of Upper Hutt in 1926. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Hutt Valley Independent documents the radical changes happening in Upper Hutt during the period 1911-1933; public services such as gas lighting and the establishment of a borough council being two examples. As it was the only community newspaper available at that time, it is a key resource for researchers and genealogists.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; I tīmataria te Hutt Valley Independent e Angus McCurdy i te tau 1911. He tangata rongonui a McCurdy i roto i te whanaketanga o Whakatiki, i te taha pāpori me te taha tōrangapū. Nāna te Poari Tāone tuatahi i whakatū i te tau 1907, tae atu ki te whare pikitia tuatahi, nāna ngā tohe kia whakaurua mai ngā raiti haukapuni i roto i Whakatiki, nāna hoki i whakatū te Hutt Valley Independent. I ngā tau o muri mai ka piki a McCurdy hei Koromatua tuatahi mō Whakatiki i te tau 1926. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I tuhia ki te Hutt Valley Independent ētahi o ngā tino huringa nunui i pā ki Whakatiki i roto i te wā 1911-1933; inā ētahi tauira e rua ko ngā raiti haukapuni me te whakatūranga o te kaunihera ā-rohe. Kua noho tēnei pepa ināianei hei tino puna mō ngā kairangahau me te hunga whai whakapapa, nā te mea koia anake te niupepa o te hapori i puta i taua wā. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Initially it was issued three times a week, but by 1891 it came out daily. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Times was started by William Joseph Potts. Potts had been involved with other newspapers on the West Coast. In 1873 he had edited Grey Valley Times at Ahaura. In 1874 he started the Reefton Courier but this didn't last out the year. Potts owned the Times until his death in 1901. His wife ran the paper after his death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Times had to compete with several other newspapers in Reefton. The main rival was the Inangahua Herald which had begun three years before the Times in 1872. The Times eventually absorbed the Herald in 1936.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1888 Reefton got a third daily newspaper, the Reefton Guardian. Reefton's population at this time was about 2,000 which was not enough to support three newspapers. The Guardian was the first to go under, probably in 1894.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not clear why a small town like Reefton had three daily newspapers. Certainly the 1890s was a flourishing time for newspaper publishing in New Zealand (newspaper publication peaked about 1910). Also it's likely that Reefton was seen as a town with prospects. Reefton was known as the "Gateway to the Coast" because most land traffic in and out of the West Coast passed through it. It had been a boom town in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1887 Reefton became the first place in New Zealand to have its own public electricity supply and in 1892 it was connected by rail to Greymouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Times, like many other small town newspapers in New Zealand, could not cope with the restrictions and shortages that the Second World War brought and it published its last issue on 6 June 1942.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Times was revived as a weekly in 1946 under the title Inangahua-Murchison Times. This paper ceased in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Because European occupation and development of the King Country came much later than most other parts of New Zealand, newspapers also came relatively late to the area. The King Country was the heart of the Maori King movement, in parts still strongly antagonistic to European settlement, so it was not until the main truck railway line pushed through the area that towns developed. The railway from Auckland reached Te Kuiti, a Maori village, in 1887. European settlement dates from that year, when a railway construction camp was established, including an iron foundry to make girders for the Waiteti Viaduct. The main trunk line slowly extended south, reaching Taumarunui in 1901. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It has been claimed that, at the beginning of the 20th century, there were 134 Europeans in Te Kuiti but the completion of the rail link brought in more settlers, the beginning of pastoral farming and cutting down of dense forests. The weekly King Country Chronicle was launched in Te Kuiti in 1906 by Arthur Hayward and Norman Matthews. The Poverty Bay Herald announced in its 2 November issue that the new paper ‘is excellently got up and has a substantial look’. Hayward left shortly afterwards, and edited the New Zealand Farmer in Auckland until his death in 1914. Matthews continued to run the paper for a number of years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the early years of settlements, newspapers saw ‘boosterism’ – the boosting and often exaggerated promotion of their communities as a key role. When Te Kuiti became a borough in 1910, the King Country Chronicle published this doggerel:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-left: 20px"&gt; ‘Ho, Te Kuiti has a Mayor&lt;br /&gt; Say the word and hold your breath&lt;br /&gt; From the Waipa right to Taupo&lt;br /&gt; She’s the greatest and the best&lt;br /&gt; From the great majestic river&lt;br /&gt; That all nations flock to see&lt;br /&gt; Westward to the rolling hills&lt;br /&gt; Te Kuiti is the town to be.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; By 1911, the European population of the King Country was just over 15,000. Te Kuiti and Taumarunui were the largest towns, each with about 1,000 Europeans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In May 1918, the New Zealand Herald announced that the Waikato Times Publishing Company and Mr W Thomas, proprietor of the Taumarunui Press, had joined interests and taken over the King Country Chronicle. ‘The business of the three papers will be run in the name of the Waikato and King Country Press’. The agreement was either very short-lived or never finalised because the next year Matthews sold the King Country Chronicle to John Hamill. His ownership was not without its difficulties. In December 1921 Hamill was the defendant in a Hamilton Supreme Court case, sued for £4,000 by the clerk of the Waitomo County Council, who alleged libel. It was decided the statements published in the King Country Chronicle were defamatory and £50 damages were awarded. The next year the paper was sold again, this time to Samuel Craig, member of an Invercargill printing and publishing family that part-owned the Southland News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The King Country Chronicle was subsequently a bi-weekly run in conjunction with the Otorohanga Times (1912), which was begun by ‘rag-planter’ J H Claridge and later purchased by the Craigs. In 1980 the King Country Chronicle and Otorohanga Times were merged. The Waitomo News, as the resulting newspaper was named, was sold to the Spring family in 2002. The free tabloid, delivered on Tuesdays and Thursdays, is part of the Spring’s privately-owned group which includes the Whakatane Beacon, Bay Weekender and Opotiki News. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I whakarewaina te nūpepa ā-wiki nei te King Country Chronicle i Te Kuiti i te tau 1906 e Arthur Hayward rāua ko Norman Matthews. E ai ki ngā kōrero a te Poverty Bay Herald i tōna putanga o te 2 Nōema ko te nūpepa hou ‘he ātaahua te takoto, he whai kiko ki te titiro atu’. Kāore i roa i muri mai ka wehe atu a Hayward ka haere hei kaiwhakatika i te New Zealand Farmer i Tāmaki-makau-rau taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1914. I whakahaere a Matthews i te nūpepa mō ētahi tau i muri mai. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I ngā tau tuatahi o ngā tāone hou ko te ‘whakarawe’ – arā, te whakarawe me te whakapai i ngā āhuatanga o ō rātou tāone tētahi whāinga nui mā ngā nūpepa o aua tāone. Nō te ekenga o Te Kuiti hei takiwā 'borough' i te tau 1910, ka whakaputaina e te King Country Chronicle tēnei ruriruri: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-left: 20px"&gt; ‘E, he koromatua tō Te Kuiti&lt;br /&gt; Whakapuakina te kupu takina te manawa&lt;br /&gt; Mai i Waipā tae noa ki Taupō&lt;br /&gt; Koia anō te mea rahi rawa, te mea hira rawa&lt;br /&gt; Mai i te awa rongonui&lt;br /&gt; Te mīharotanga a ngā whenua o te ao&lt;br /&gt; Ahu whaka-te-uru ki ngā pīnanakitanga&lt;br /&gt; Ko Te Kuiti ia te tāone ka manakohia.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te taenga ki te tau 1911, kua piki iti ake te taupori o te Rohe Pōtae i te 15,000. Ko Te Kuiti me Taumarunui ngā tāone nunui rawa, 1,000 nga Pākehā o tētehi, o tētehi. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te marama o Mei 1918, ka whakapuakina e te New Zealand Herald kua tūhono te Waikato Times Publishing Company rāua ko W Thomas, te rangatira o te Taumarunui Press, i ō rātou hea, ā, kua noho tahi hei rangatira mō te King Country Chronicle. ‘Ka whakahaeretia ngā kaipakihi o ngā nūpepa e toru i raro i te ingoa te Waikato and King Country Press’. Heoi anō, he poto noa iho te wā o te kirimana, kāore i oti mārire rānei, inā hoki, i te tau i muri ka hokona te King Country Chronicle ki a John Hamill. Ehara i te mea kāore he raruraru o tōna wā i te nūpepa. Nō te marama o Tīhema 1921 ko Hamill te tangata e whakapaetia ana i tētahi take ki te Kōti Teitei o Kirikiriroa mō te £4,000 he mea whakapae e te Waitomo County Council, mō te hāhani. Ka whakatauria, āe, he hāhani tonu ngā kupu i puta i te King Country Chronicle me te whakawhiwhi i ngā moni kāpeneheihana £50. I te tau i muri mai ka hokona anō te nūpepa, ki Samuel Craig, he mema nō tētahi whānau tā-nūpepa, tā-pukapuka nō Te Waihōpai, nō rātou tētahi wāhi o te Southland News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I muri i tērā, e rua ngā putanga o te King Country Chronicle i te wiki, i te taha o te Otorohanga Times (1912), nā tētehi ‘rag-planter’ nā J H Claridge i tīmata, ā, i hokona i muri e te whānau Craig. I te tau 1980 ka whakakotahitia te King Country Chronicle me te Otorohanga Times. Ko te nūpepa i hua ake ka whakaingoatia ko te Waitomo News, ā, ka hokona ki te whānau Spring i te tau 2002. He nūpepa whāiti kore-utu tēnei i tohangia i ngā Tūrei me ngā Tāite. He wāhi tēnei nō te huinga nūpepa tūmataiti a Spring kei roto nei te Whakatane Beacon, Bay Weekender me Opotiki News. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The key people in this association were Charles Davis, Te Irimana and Raureti Mokonuiarangi. Their prime objectives were to spread the Gospel among all people, to encourage temperance, hygiene and habits of industry, and to educate their people and supply general news of current events. From January 1886, the change for the better was reflected in the publication of more letters, matters such as the landslip in which Te Heuheu was killed, the Tarawera eruption, and Te Kooti&amp;#39;s prophecies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last issue of Te Korimako was published in Auckland in May 1888. Eighteen months later the newspaper was revived in Opotiki as Te Korimako Hou (1890), edited by Reverend George Maunsell. There is more local (Opotiki and Tauranga) news in the revived newspaper than in its predecessor.

My desire is that this newspaper should be circulated in all respective places once a month, or once a fortnight, or once a week; for the matter will depend on you and myself.&amp;rsquo; (ki taua tuhinga anō)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te hiahia ngā rangatira o te niupepa ki te hiki i te iwi Māori kia ahu whakamua, mā te hora mai i &amp;lsquo;ētahi tuhinga akoako, whakaū i te oranga&amp;rsquo;, mō te utu ngāwari mō te katoa&amp;rsquo; (16 Mei 1882: 1).

Mai i te marama o Hānuere 1886, ka kitea te pikinga ake nā te mea he maha atu ngā reta i roto, pēnei i te horo nui i Tokaanu i mate ai a Te Heuheu, te hūnga o te maunga o Tarawera me ngā kupu whakaari a Te Kooti.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I rere te putanga whakamutunga o Te Korimako i Tāmakimakaurau i te marama o Mei 1888.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Kai Tiaki - the Journal of the Nurses of New Zealand, as it was originally titled, was founded by the indomitable nursing visionary Hester Maclean, who came to New Zealand from Australia in 1906 to take up the government role of Assistant Inspector of Hospitals. In this role, she had oversight of all nursing matters. Using her own funds and working in her own time, she established Kai Tiaki, first published in January 1908. The quarterly publication cost the princely sum of four shillings a year. In her inaugural editorial on the purposes of the journal, Maclean said she wanted it to be ‘. . . a bond of union, a common interest, a means of communication, a mutual help, and a road to improvement in their professional work and knowledge, to all nurses of the Dominion . . .’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Maclean chose the title, wanting it to be distinctive and suggestive of the journal’s country of origin. It was suggested to her by a Government interpreter, in response to a request from Maclean. Kai tiaki, in Māori, contains meanings associated with guardianship and protection. The journal has undergone a number of name changes but, despite its official titles, it has always been referred to by the profession at large, as simply Kai Tiaki. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was first registered as a magazine in 1912. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maclean maintained ownership of the journal, which reported extensively on nurses’ involvement in World War 1 and on the influenza epidemic of 1918, in which more than 8000 New Zealanders, including some 30 nurses, died. In 1919 a complete set of journals covering the period of the First World War, 1914-1918, was deposited in the British War Museum in London. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1923, the New Zealand Trained Nurses’ Association (NZTNA), founded in 1909, bought Kai Tiaki from Maclean, who remained as editor. The journal subscription increased to six shillings a year. The following year the first sub-editor was appointed, and in 1930 Kai Tiaki expanded to become a bi-monthly publication. That year also saw a name change to New Zealand Nursing Journal (Kai Tiaki). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1932 Maclean, the journal’s founder and editor for 24 years, died. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; From 1939 to 1947 Kai Tiaki was published monthly but in 1942 wartime regulations controlling the use of newsprint saw the number of pages in each issue reduced to 28, then 24. From 1947 to 1959, Kai Tiaki was published two monthly, returning to monthly publication at the dawn of the new decade. 1957 was literally a red letter day for the journal, when it used colour on its cover for the first time and 1958 saw the publication of a Golden Jubilee issue. Kai Tiaki continued to be published monthly until 1988, when publication was reduced to 11 times a year, with a combined December/January issue. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;In 1905, Charles de La Roche started the weekly Kaipara Advertiser and Waitemata Chronicle in Helensville. He launched his first newspaper, the Tauranga Herald, in 1899, but the bi-weekly survived for only a few months. His next venture, the Rodney and Otamatea Times, based in Warkworth, was to prove much more successful. Late in 1903 he sold the newspaper, moved his real estate business to Helensville and established his third newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; In 1905, Charles de La Roche started the weekly Kaipara Advertiser and Waitemata Chronicle in Helensville. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A 41-year-old entrepreneur, de La Roche was born and grew up in New South Wales. At 21 he was an officer in the Australian Imperial Forces and served in the Sudan War in 1885. Several years later he resigned his commission and moved to New Zealand. Already an experienced journalist, he contributed to a number of South Auckland newspapers while establishing a real estate business at Pukekohe. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He launched his first newspaper, the Tauranga Herald, in 1899, but the bi-weekly survived for only a few months. His next venture, the Rodney and Otamatea Times, based in Warkworth, was to prove much more successful. Late in 1903 he sold the newspaper, moved his real estate business to Helensville and established his third newspaper. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Helensville had been settled in 1863 by Scottish timber millers and kauri milling underwrote the town’s early development, with dairy farming of increasing importance by the beginning of the 20th century. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Kaipara Advertiser and Waitemata Chronicle had several more owners before Francis Mackenzie absorbed the paper into his Kaipara and Waitemata Echo in 1914. The Echo began publishing in 1907 and the new weekly was soon outperforming its competitor. Mackenzie, a colourful newspaperman who started several Northland newspapers, had worked for the Government Printer in Sydney and was an overseer at Auckland’s Southern Cross before founding his most successful publication, the Northern Luminary, in Kawakawa in 1879. He sold this paper in 1913. Known for the robustness of his journalism he was taken to court for libel and was once attacked in the street by someone claiming he had been defamed. Son Frank took over the Echo when his father died in 1917 and ran it until he retired. C J Claridge, junior, owned the paper until 1927 and then sold to Hilton Venables. The Echo was subsequently incorporated into the Rodney and Otamatea Courier. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

Ētahi tau i muri mai ka tukua e ia tana kōmihana ka nuku mai ki Aotearoa. Kua tautōhito kē ia ki ngā mahi kawe kōrero, ā, i riro nāna i tuhi kōrero mō ētahi o ngā niupepa o Manukau, o Pukekohe i a ia e whakatū ana i tētahi umanga hoko kāinga hoko whenua i Pukekohe. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ka whakarewaina e ia tana niupepa tuatahi, te Tauranga Herald, i te tau 1899, engari i ora mai te niupepa rua-putanga-i-te-wiki mō ētahi marama noa iho. Otiia ko tana umanga o muri mai, te Rodney and Otamatea Times, i puta rā i Warkworth, tērā noa ake te painga i puta. No ngā marama whakamutunga o 1903 ka hokona e ia te niupepa, ka nekehia e ia tana umanga hoko whenua, hoko kāinga ki Helensville, ka whakatūria hoki e ia tana niupepa tuatoru. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kua whakanohonoho mai ngā kaituatua rākau, kaimira kauri mai i Kotirani ki Helensvillei te tau 1863, nā rātou anō i punga te whanaketanga o te tāone i aua tau tuatahi, ā, i te takanga o ngā tau ka piki hoki te hua o te mahi pāmu kau kūtētē kia tae ki te tīmatanga o te rau tau 20. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Arā anō ngā rangatira o te Kaipara Advertiser and Waitemata Chronicle i mua i te rironga o te niupepa i a Francis Mackenzie ki roto i tāna Kaipara and Waitemata Echo i te tau 1914. I tīmata te puta o te Echo i te tau 1907, ā, kāore i roa i muri mai ka kaha ake tāna mahi i tōna hoa tauwhāinga. He kaihautū niupepa ingoa-nui a Mackenzie, i riro nāna i tīmata ētahi niupepa o Te Tai Tokerau. I mahi ia mō te Kaitā Kāwanatanga i Poihākena, ā, he kaiārahi ia i te Southern Cross o Tāmaki-makaurau i mua i tāna whakatūranga i tōna niupepa tino whai painga rawa, te Northern Luminary, i Kawakawa i 1879. Ka hokona e ia tēnei niupepa i te tau 1913. I mōhio nuitia mō te hāngai o āna tuhinga kōrero, ā, ka whakapaetia ia i mua i te Kōti e tētahi tangata kē atu mō te whakahahani i a ia. Nā tana tama a Frank i kawe te Echo i muri i te matenga o tōna matua i te tau 1917, ka haere tonu taea noatia te tukunga i tana tūranga. I riro nā C J Claridge, tama, i whakahaere te niupepa tae noa ki te tau 1927 kātahi ka hokona e ia ki Hilton Venables. Nō muri mai ka hanumitia te Echo ki roto i te Rodney and Otamatea Courier. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

Its content was royal tours, society weddings and Māori maidens; overt political comment was avoided. The Mirror&amp;rsquo;s literary standards were deeply conservative. It carried genre fiction &amp;ndash; courtship, romance, adventure and mystery &amp;ndash; from popular writers like Dorothy Eden and Essie Summers. By the early 1960s the Mirror had lost ground to other magazines. It folded in 1963.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ben Schrader. &amp;#39;Magazines and periodicals - Popular magazines, 1920 to 1939&amp;#39;, Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 24-Sep-14&lt;br /&gt; URL: &lt;a href="http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/magazines-and-periodicals/page-3"&gt;http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/magazines-and-periodicals/page-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Lake County Mail appears to be the short-lived successor to Queenstown&amp;rsquo;s Lake Wakatip Mail and the Lake County Press which it had absorbed previously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During its early years, the Lake Wakatip Mail was, as Queenstown prospered, a bi-weekly that regularly ran to eight pages. In February 1875, with &amp;lsquo;a reduced population, stagnation in trade, and lack of enterprise&amp;rsquo;, it became a weekly. In 1926, the Mail absorbed Arrowtown&amp;rsquo;s struggling Lake County Press. It survived another 21 years before closing in February 1947. Shortly afterwards, the Lake County Mail &amp;ndash; using part of each paper&amp;rsquo;s name &amp;ndash; appeared for less than a year. There is no published information about the publication, thought to be a weekly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has been recorded that, in February 1948, three Central Otago newspapers merged. Stevens Bros, long-time owners of the Alexandra Herald and Central Otago Gazette and more recent publishers of the Dunstan Times, combined these papers with the Lake County Mail. The resulting Central Otago News was published twice weekly (Tuesdays and Thursdays) and based in Alexandra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Explaining the decision, an editorial in the Alexandra Herald said: &amp;lsquo;While appreciating the fact that local people cherish a genuine fondness for their &amp;lsquo;local rag&amp;rsquo;, we feel that this step towards combining the interests of Central Otago is one that is wise and necessary .... We feel that Central is no longer a series of isolated, individual towns and districts with widely divergent interests, but is rapidly developing into a coherent whole, one community, Central Otago.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of 2015, the Lakes District and Central Otago News was a tabloid weekly, owned by Allied Press, publishers of the Otago Daily Times.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I pakari haere ia i te whanaketanga o ngā mahi ohaoha o Kuīnitāone. Nō te marama o Pēpuere 1875, nā runga i &amp;#39;te hekenga o te taupori, te pōroritanga o ngā mahi hokohoko, me te korenga e whai wāhi ki te tupu o ngā umanga,&amp;#39; ka heke haere hei niupepa ā-wiki. I te tau 1926, ka horomia e te Mail te Lake County Press, tētahi niupepa māuiui tonu nei, o Arrowtown. I ora mai ia mō tētahi atu 21 tau i mua i tōna katinga i te marama o Pēpuere 1947. Taro kau, ka puta mai ko te Lake County Mail &amp;ndash; i whakamahi rā i tētahi wāhi o te ingoa o ia niupepa &amp;ndash; engari he iti iho i te kotahi tau tāna puta ki te ao. Kāore kau he kōrero i āta tāia ki te pukapuka mō taua nupepa, he niupepa ā-wiki e ai ki ētahi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kua oti te tuhituhi, nō te marama o Pēpuere 1948, i hanumi ētahi niupepa mai i te riu o Matau kia kotahi. Nā ngā Stevens Bros ēnei niupepa i haumi kia kotahi ki te Lake County Mail. Ko rāua ngā rangatira o te Alexandra Herald and Central Otago Gazette, mō te wā roa, ā, i mua tata ake ko rāua ngā kaiwhakaputa o te Dunstan Times.&amp;nbsp; E rua ngā putanga ia wiki (Tūrei me te Tāite) o te niupepa i hua ake, arā, te&amp;nbsp; Central Otago News, ā, ko tōna kāinga ko Alexandra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hei whakamārama i tāna whakatau, i kī te tuhinga ētita a te&amp;nbsp; Alexandra Herald: &amp;lsquo;Ahakoa e mārama ana mātou ki te aroha o te iwi o te rohe ki tā rātou&amp;nbsp; &amp;lsquo;local rag&amp;rsquo;, e mea ana mātou he tino huarahi tēnei hei whakakotahi i ngā pānga o te riu katoa o te awa o Matau, he mahi i runga i te whakaaro nui me te mōhio ki te huarahi tika hoki mō ngā rā kei mua .... E mea ana mātou ehara a Central i te rohe kī katoa i ngā tāone motuhake noa iho, he rerekē ngā tirohanga, engari e tupu mai ana hei hapori kotahi, arā, Central Otago.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tau 2015, he niupepa ā-puka iti ā-wiki te Lakes District and Central Otago News, ko ōna rangatira ko Allied Press, ngā kaiwhakaputa o te Otago Daily Times.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The predecessor of the Lake County Press, the Arrow Observer and Lakes District Chronicle, published its first issue on 23 May 1871 in the gold-mining settlement of Arrowtown. William Warren of Queenstown&amp;rsquo;s Lake Wakatip Mail and Stephen Noble Brown, who later ran the Cromwell Argus, were involved in the establishment of the Observer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At around the same as the Arrow Observer began, a rival in the form of the Arrow Advocate and Wakatip Reporter also appeared. Little is known about this newspaper and it is thought that no issues have survived. The owners of the Cromwell Argus were involved in establishing the Advocate and the Otago Daily Times commented that its first issue &amp;lsquo;contains a large amount of reading matter, well selected and arranged&amp;rsquo;. Competition between the Observer and the Advocate appears to have been strong, with the Otago Witness commenting that they &amp;lsquo;devote a large portion of their space to abusing each other.&amp;rsquo; The Observer won the paper war, with the Advocate&amp;rsquo;s demise being reported in September 1871.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Arrow Observer continued until 1882; its struggles over the years were acknowledged by its last owner Ebenezer Sandford who commented in the final issue on &amp;lsquo;the poor figure cut by the paper&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Observer was replaced by the Lake County Press, which was published by Sandford and J T Marryat Hornsby. In 1883 rivalry with the Lake Wakatip Mail escalated into legal proceedings after the Mail published a scathing article about a public address by Hornsby. Hornsby was awarded damages for libel after the jury held that the Mail had implied Hornsby was a convict by saying he came from Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Philip de la Perrelle, who was only in his early twenties, bought the Lake County Press in 1895 and ran the newspaper until 1914. De la Perrelle was later elected to Parliament and served as Minister of Internal Affairs from 1928-1931 in the Ward and Forbes cabinets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lake County Press ran until 1928 when it was absorbed by the Lake Wakatip Mail. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I whai wāhi ngā rangatira o te Cromwell Argus ki roto i te whakatūranga o te Advocate. Ka puta te kōrero a te Otago Daily Times &amp;lsquo;he maha tonu ngā kai o roto hei pānuitanga, he pai te whiriwhiri kōrero e te etita, me te whakatakoto&amp;#39; o te putanga tuatahi.

I te tau 1883 ka pakaru mai tētahi take ki te kōti, nā runga i ngā mahi tauwhāinga o te niupepa ki te Lake Wakatip Mail. I takea mai tēnei i te whakaputanga a te Mail i tētahi tuhinga whakahāwea mō tētahi kauwhau nā Hornsby. I whiwhi kāpeneheihana a Hornsby mō ngā tūkinotanga i tōna ingoa,&amp;nbsp; i te ekenga o tana whakapae i te kitenga a te tekau mā rua nā te Mail i whakairi te whakaaro he mauhere a Hornsby nā te mea i ahu mai ia i Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahakoa neke iti ake ōna tau i te rua tekau ka hokona e Philip de la Perrelle te Lake County Press i te tau 1895, ā, ka whakahaeretia e ia taea noatia te tau 1914. I pōtitia a de la Perrelle ki te Whare Pāremata, ā, ka piki hei Minita mō ngā Take Taiwhenua mai i 1928-1931 i ngā rūnanga a Ward me Forbes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I haere tonu te Lake County Press taea noatia te tau 1928, kātahi ka horomia e te Lake Wakatip Mail.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Lyell, in the South Island’s Buller district, was a major producer of gold and the centre of considerable quartz mining activity in the surrounding hills until the mid 1890s. Gold was first discovered in the area by Maori prospectors in the early 1860s. As word spread of their finds, miners arrived from other fields and overseas. The only access was by canoe on the Buller River with its many rapids and it was some years before a road was built along the banks of the Buller Gorge.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Lyell, in the South Island’s Buller district, was a major producer of gold and the centre of considerable quartz mining activity in the surrounding hills until the mid 1890s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Gold was first discovered in the area by Maori prospectors in the early 1860s. As word spread of their finds, miners arrived from other fields and overseas. The only access was by canoe on the Buller River with its many rapids and it was some years before a road was built along the banks of the Buller Gorge. Cliff Street, Lyell’s only street, where its banks, hotels and newspaper were located, was constructed in the 1870s. By then, the wives and families of miners had arrived, tents along Lyell Creek were replaced by houses around Cliff Street and a more settled community flourished until it had a population of more than 2,000 in the late 1880s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first newspaper, the Lyell Argus and Matakitaki Advertiser, launched in 1873, was published weekly, and for a time twice weekly. Its four pages carried international and local news, particularly mining developments and advertisements for the growing number of retailers along Cliff Street. It was run by James Graham Niven and later by Thomas John Metcalfe. It closed in 1882, very likely because of the arrival of a competitor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Lyell Times and Central Buller Gazette was begun in 1881 by Edward Percy Smyrk. He had served an apprenticeship under John Tyrrell, then owner of the Westport Times, before working on the Inangahua Times in Reefton. After Smyrk sold the Lyell Times to Walter Atkin in 1888 he worked on the Westport Times again. Later, as proprietor of the short-lived Gisborne newspaper the New Zealand Standard, he filed for bankruptcy in 1892, with liabilities of £349, more than three times his available assets. Interestingly, among his debtors were two well-known newspapermen, Henry Brett and William G Geddis. He subsequently worked on Hawke’s Bay newspapers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Walter Atkin, originally from Ireland, had managed the Inangahua Times before taking over the Lyell Times. In 1896, the paper’s Cliff Street office was victim of a major fire that also destroyed the National Bank, three hotels and a number of other buildings. Few of the businesses were insured, but Atkin was covered for £200. With the township badly affected by the fire, Atkin closed the Lyell Times a couple of years later and purchased the Westport News, a morning daily. Unlike many early newspaper proprietors he left a sizeable estate – £2,326 – on his death in 1911. (About $375,000 today.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lyell recovered to some degree from the 1896 fire, but the closure of the area’s largest mine a decade later led to a major exodus of residents. A number of surviving buildings were destroyed by another fire in 1926 and most of those still living there left after the 1929 Murchison earthquake. Today the cemetery and a picnic ground with display boards outlining the area’s history are all that remain. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Ko te tāone o Lyell, i te riu o te Kawatiri i te Waipounamu tētahi wāhi kaha tāna whakaputa kōura, ā, koia te pūtahi o ngā mahi keri kiripaka i ngā hiwi i te taha taea noatia ngā tau i takiwā o 1894-1896. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I kitea tuatahitia te kōura e ngā kairapurapu Māori i ngā tau tuatahi o te tekau tau mai i 1860. Ka poia te rongo o tā rātou i kite ai ki ngā wāhi o te ao, me te waipuke mai o ngā kaikeri mai i ētahi atu rohe me tāwāhi anō hoki. Heoi anō nei te urunga mai he hoehoe waka mā te awa o Kawatiri me ōna tini tāheke, ā, nō ngā tau maha i muri mai kātahi anō ka hangaia he rori i te kūititanga o te Awahuri. I hangaia tōna tiriti kotahi anake, te tiriti o Cliff , Lyell i te tekau tau mai i 1870. I reira ngā pēke, ngā hōtēra me te tari nūpepa o te tāone. Nō te taenga ki tērā wā, kua taetae mai ngā wāhine me ngā whānau o ngā kaikeri, ā, kua ngaro ngā tēneti i te taha o Lyell Creek, me te tū mai o ngā whare i te Tiriti o Cliff. Ka tupu mai he hapori āhua toitū, ā, ka piki te taupori kia neke atu i te 2,000 i ngā tau mai i 1886 ki 1890. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I whakarewaina te nūpepa tuatahi, te Lyell Argus and Matakitaki Advertiser, i te tau 1873, ā, kotahi putanga i te wiki, ā, i muri e rua ngā putanga i te wiki mō tētahi wā. I roto i ōna whārangi e whā ngā pitopito kōrero o te ao, o te takiwā, otirā ngā āhuatanga keri kōura katoa, ngā pānui mai i ngā toa hokohoko huri noa i te Tiriti o Cliff. He mea whakahaere e James Graham Niven ā, i ngā tau ki muri nā Thomas John Metcalfe. I katia i te tau 1882, te āhua nei nā te taenga mai o tētahi hoa tauwhāinga. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I tīmataria te Lyell Times and Central Buller Gazette i te tau 1881 e Edward Percy Smyrk. I akoako ia i raro i a John Tyrrell, te rangatira i taua wā o te Westport Times, i mua i tana mahi i te Inangahua Times i Rīwhitana. I muri i te hokonga a Smyrk i te Lyell Times ki a Walter Atkin i te tau 1888 i mahi anō ia i teWestport Times. Nō muri mai, hei rangatira o te nūpepa o Tūranga nui a Kiwa e mōhiotia ko te New Zealand Standard ka tono ia ki te kōti pēkerapu i te tau 1892. Ko ngā nama i eke ki te £349, e toru whakareanga tēnei o āna rawa. He mea anō, i waenga i ōna hoa noho nama ki a ia tokorua ngā kaimahi nūpepa, a Henry Brett rāua ko William G Geddis. Nō muri ka mahi ia i ētahi nūpepa i te Matau a Māui. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kua whakahaeretia e Walter Atkin, mai i Airani i mua, te Inangahua Times i mua i tana whakahaere i te Lyell Times. I te tau 1896, ka wera te tari o te nūpepa i te Tiriti o Cliff i te ahi, nāna hoki i kai te Pēke National, ngā hōtēra e toru me ētahi atu whare. He iti noa ngā umanga i inihuatia engari i te inihuatia a Atkin mō te £200. I tino kino te raru o te tāone i te ahi, ā, ka kati a Atkin i te Lyell Times ā, e rua tau ki muri ka huri ki te hoko i teWestport News, he nūpepa ata ā-rā. Kāore i rite ki ētahi atu rangatira nūpepa o aua tau tuatahi, arā, ka waiho e ia ētahi moni nui ki ana uri - £2,326 – i tōna matenga i te tau 1911. (tata ki te $375,000 i ngā moni o nāianei.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I hoki mai anō tōna ora ki Lyell, me kī tōna ora nei, i muri i te ahi o 1896 , engari nā te katinga o te keringa nui rawa i muri ka tino mimiti katoa atu te nui o ōna tāngata. Tērā ētahi atu whare i ngaro i te ahi i te tau 1926 ā, ka wehe atu te nuinga o te hunga i te noho tonu i reira i muri i te rū nui o Murchison i te tau 1929.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Following the discovery of gold on the banks of the Shotover River in November 1862, the town of Queenstown appeared almost overnight and the first issue of the Lake Wakatip Mail followed soon after on 2 May 1863. The Otago Daily Times of 18 May 1863 commented about the Mail that ‘it seems difficult to realise ... that such a paper should be published in Queenstown, a place which six months ago was the head station of a runholder, and nothing more’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; James Bradshaw, who later achieved prominence as a Member of Parliament and as an important early advocate of labour law reform, worked as an editor of the Mail. However, the key figure in the early life of the paper was William Warren, who became part owner of the paper in 1864 and sole owner in 1867. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When gold was discovered on the West Coast, many miners moved on, and the Mail struggled to survive in the severe slump that followed. In April 1867 the Mail announced it would cease publication but was revived after missing only one issue. In its early years, flood and fire also added to the Mail’s difficulties. In 1878 the lower part of Queenstown was flooded and the Mail’s stock damaged; worse was to follow in 1879 when two of Warren’s children lit some paper and the Mail’s office was completely destroyed by fire, along with a supply of new type and materials that had only been received from Melbourne the previous day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1883 Warren found himself in legal strife after the Mail published a scathing article about a public address by J T Marryat Hornsby of the neighbouring Arrowtown newspaper, the Lake County Press. Hornsby sued for damages for libel and succeeded when the jury held that the Mail had implied that Hornsby was a convict by saying he came from Tasmania. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After William Warren died the Warren family continued to be involved with the Mail for many years. During the First World War, Margaret (Daisy) Warren took over management of the paper when her brother enlisted for service, despite prejudice and doubt over her suitability for the role. Daisy proved to be highly successful in her new position and after the war continued to have a prominent role in the running of the Mail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1928 the Lake Wakatip Mail absorbed the Lake County Press and continued to be published until 6 February 1947. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I puta te kī a te Otago Daily Times i te 18 Mei 1863 mō te Mail, pēnei "he uaua hopu a te hinengaro ... i tēnei āhua, kia tū he nūpepa pēnei i Queenstown, he takiwā tēnei he teihana pāmu matua noa iho nā tētahi kaipupuru whenua, kāore kau atu i reira e ono marama ki muri’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I mahi a James Bradshaw, hei etita mō te Mail. He tangata tēnei i hau te rongo hei Mema Pāremata, hei kaikauwhau tuatahi mō te whakatikatika i ngā ture mō te hunga mahi i ōna rā. Ahakoa, ko te tino kaihautū matua i ngā tau tuatahi ko William Warren, i eke rā hei rangatira mō ētahi o ngā hea o te nūpepa i te tau 1864 ā, ka noho hoki hei kaipupuru hea takitahi i te tau 1867. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te kitenga i te taonga nei i te kōura i te Tai Poutini ka hūnuku atu te tini o ngā kaikeri, ā, ka uaua tonu te haere o te Mail i ngā tāpokopokotanga whai i muri. I te marama o Āperira 1867 ka puta te kī a te Mail ka mutu tāna puta ki te ao engari i whakaorangia mai anō i muri i te hapanga kotahi. I ōna tau tuatahi, nā te waipuke, nā te kānga hoki o te ahi i haupū ai he uauatanga mō te Mail. I te tau 1878 ka waipuketia te wāhanga o raro o Queenstown me te raru anō o ngā rawa o te Mail; engari he kino kē atu te aitua i whai i muri i te tau 1879. Nā ētahi tamariki tokorua a Warren i tahu pepa, ā, ka toro te ahi, kainga katoatia ana te tari o te Mail e te ahi, tae atu ki ngā pūranga poraka tā me ngā rawa kātahi anō ka tae mai i Poipiripi i te rā o mua atu. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1883 ka taka a Warren ki tētahi raruraru ā-ture i tāna whakaputanga i tētahi tuhinga whiu kōrero i te Mail mō tētahi kauwhau tūmatanui nā J T Marryat Hornsby nō te nūpepa o te tāonga tūtata o Arrowtown nō te Lake County Press. I hāmene a Hornsby i a ia mō ngā tūkinotanga i te tuhinga, ā i eke tana whakapae i te kitenga a te tekau mā rua nā te Mail i whakairi te whakaaro he mauhere a Hornsby nā te mea i ahu mai ia i Tasmania. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I muri i te matenga o William Warren i haere tonu te mahi tahitanga a te whānau Warren ki ngā mahi te Mail mō ngā tau maha rawa.

The paper&amp;#39;s purpose was to generate support for Māori &amp;nbsp;grievances from the Pākehā community. Many of the subscribers were members of the New Zealand Bar and judges.

The Maori Record is critical of Sir James Carroll and his Government&amp;#39;s Māori &amp;nbsp;land policies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first issues, like Te Puke ki Hikurangi, were funded by the Wairarapa chieftainess Niniwa-i-te-rangi. Later issues were funded by Rangi Topeora, Kuini Wi Rangipupu (Mrs R S Thompson), and Wikitoria Taitoko. The Maori Record was edited by R S Thompson and was issued monthly at 3 pence per copy or 12 shillings and 6 pence per annum payable in advance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From August 1906, the banner includes: It is the peculiar misfortune of New Zealand natives, that they are alternatively treated as British subjects, or as foreigners, according to the interest or caprice of their British rulers &amp;ndash; GORST. This banner by Gorst, the former Waikato Resident Magistrate during the 1860 Land Wars, sums up the tenor of the paper and its theme of settling Māori on their own land. It refers to Māori people being charged rates for their land as were all British subjects, but at the same time not given clear title by which to raise money, or subsidies by Government, to develop their own land into productive farming units.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After several years, The Maori Record ceased. The editorial in the last issue notes: &amp;lsquo;Compared with two years ago the proposals for the administration of Maori lands are much improved....All we claim is that the RECORD has assisted in working the change&amp;rsquo; (June, 1907: 99).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Library would like to thank Gail Dallimore for providing information used in essays about Maori newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Mataura Ensign, named after the Scottish newspaper, the Northern Ensign, was first produced in Gore (in Southland) on the 10 May 1878. The early years of the paper had a strong literary flavour including regular articles from 'Uncle Phil' who encouraged children to write well. The paper is still published daily today as the Ensign.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
      <Description language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Ko te Mataura Ensign i puta mai i te tāone o Gore i Murihiku i te 10 o Haratua i te tau 1878. I tapaina taua ingoa mai i te nūpepa o Kotarangi (Scotland) e kīia nei ko te Northern Ensign. I te tīmatanga, he nūpepa tuhituhi mātauranga anake, ā, he nui hoki ngā tuhituhinga o "Uncle Phil". Ko tana mahi he whakakaha i ngā tamariki kia pai rātau ki te tuhituhi. Kei te tū tonu taua nūpepa ēngari ko tana ingoa ināianei ko te Ensign.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Mataura Ensign began publication in Gore (in Southland) on 10 May 1878 by Joseph Mackay who owned the Bruce Herald in Milton at the time. He ensured that his new venture began soundly by first securing backing from several of the Mataura Valley's prominent businessmen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper's name was suggested by Mackay's business partner George Renner, after the Scottish newspaper the Northern Ensign. Renner and his partner James Sinclair canvassed the district for subscribers and advertisers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Milton newspaper publisher Alfred Dolamore bought the Ensign in August 1882. Mackay went on to establish the Southern Free Press at Mataura but this paper failed to compete with the Mataura Ensign, as did its later rival, the Gore Standard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dolamore had previous experience on the Nelson Evening Mail and Southland Times. The Mataura Ensign expanded rapidly under Dolamore and he took on additional partners including his brother Howard. The paper moved into larger premises and increased the circulation area. Dolamore died in 1895 and after a disastrous fire which destroyed everything except the printing machine, the paper moved to new premises in Mersey Street, Gore. The Ensign became a daily in April 1906.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the Dolamore's stewardship the paper retained a strong literary flavour, claiming amongst its staff the noted historian James Herries Beattie (1881-1972). He compiled extensive files on the history of Southland through oral interviews and correspondence. William Gilchrist, headmaster of East Gore School from 1891, wrote as "Uncle Phil" for many years, encouraging children to write well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1920 the Gore Publishing Company was formed and included a number of the paper's employee. The newspaper changed its name to the Ensign in 1973 and is still published daily.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Ka nuku taua nūpepa ki roto kē i tētahi tari nui kē, ā, ka rahi kē atu anō te rohe e kapi ai. I te tau 1895 ka mate a Dolamore, ā, i muri atu i tētahi ahi nunui nei ka ngaro katoa te tari, ā, ko te mīhini tā nūpepa anake i toe. Ka nuku te nūpepa ki tētahi whare hou i te tiriti o Mersey, i te tāone o Gore. Nō te marama o Paenga-whāwhā i te tau 1906, ka puta mai ia rā taua nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I raro i te kaiārahitanga o Dolamore, ka mau tonu te kaupapa whakaputa tuhituhinga mātauranga. I taua wā anō ko tētahi o ngā kaimahi o taua nūpepa nā, ko tētahi tonu o ngā toa mō te tuhituhi kōrero o nehe. Ko James Herries Beattie (1881-1972) tana ingoa. I hangaia e ia ētahi tukunga kōrero e pā ana ki te tāhuhu korero o Murihiku. I hopukina e ia aua kōrero mai i te kōrero ā-kanohi me te tuhi anō hoki ki ētahi atu tāngata. Ko te kaituhi "Uncle Phil" ko William Gilchrist, te tumuaki o te kura o Gore ki te rāwhiti. I tuhi ia mai i te tau 1891, ā, mō ngā tau nui ki muri hoki. Ko tana mahi hei whakakaha i ngā taitamariki kia tino pai ake tā rātau tuhi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1920, ka whakatūria te kamupene whakaputa pukapuka, arā, te Gore Publishing Company, ā, i nui tonu ngā kaimahi o te nūpepa i mahi i taua kamupene nā. I te tau 1973 ka tīnihia te ingoa o te nūpepa rā ki te Ensign, ā, e haere tonu nei i tēnei wā hei nūpepa e tāngia ana ia rā, ia rā.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Marlborough Express is the daily newspaper of Blenheim and has been published there since 1866.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1866 the prospects for a new newspaper in Marlborough were not good. The population of the province was small and Marlborough already had two newspapers. A third, the Marlborough Times, had folded the year before after a few months in operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Express was founded by Samuel Johnson. Johnson already had some experience as a journalist in England and New Zealand. He had arrived in 1862 with the Albertians, a band of idealistic settlers who settled in North Auckland. Johnson edited the Albertian newspaper the Albertland Gazette for a short time until he became disillusioned with the settlement. He then worked on newspapers in other parts of the country before settling on Blenheim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Politics in Marlborough was dominated by rivalry between Blenheim and Picton, and this was reflected in the Marlborough newspapers. Originally the Press was published in Blenheim but had moved to Picton. The publishers tried to placate Blenheim residents by saying that the paper was actually published in both places, but eventually they had to publish a separate Blenheim paper, the Wairau Record. When launching the Express Johnson promised to give Marlborough a paper that would serve the whole province. Perhaps it was this attempt to rise above the squabbling between Blenheim and Picton that helped the Express establish itself and ultimately prevail over its rivals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1879 Johnson sold the Express to Smith Furness and James Boudy. Furness had worked on newspapers in Wellington, Nelson, and Ashburton. The Furness family controlled the Express until 1998 when it was sold to Independent Newspapers Limited (INL). The Express became a daily in 1880 and took over its rivals the Marlborough Times in 1895 and the Marlborough Press in 1948.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Newspaper publishing began in the Foxton area in the 1870s when the Manawatu was opened up for European settlement. In this period Foxton’s port was developed and the town was linked by coach and rail to the main centres in the lower North Island.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Manawatu Herald was founded by brothers George Warren Russell and John Ruffell Russell in 1878. It was the first paper published in Foxton, following unsuccessful attempts in 1873 to publish a newspaper called the Manawatu Guardian. George Russell had worked on newspapers in Invercargill and Wellington and went on to work on others, in particular the Spectator in Christchurch. He was also a prominent Member of the House of Representatives and cabinet minister during the First World War. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;George Russell did not stay with the Herald for long. By 1882 he had moved on to the Manawatu Times in Palmerston North leaving his brother with the Foxton paper. The Herald was sold to Ernest Thynne in 1889. During Thynne’s tenure the Herald had a rival paper to contend with, the Foxton Telegraph, which ran for four years from 1896. The local council appear to have encouraged the Telegraph by dividing council advertising between it and the Herald. This was probably because Thynne and the Herald represented the rural lobby in Foxton.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1906 Thynne sold the paper to John Knowles Hornblow. Hornblow came from a family of newspapermen; his father wrote for the New Zealand Times, and Hornblow and his brothers worked on various Wairarapa newspapers. Hornblow owned the Wairarapa Standard in Greytown before taking over the Herald.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Hornblow took over the Herald, Foxton was a town with prospects. There were plans to extend the port and it was hoped that the main trunk line would go through Foxton. Unfortunately within a year or two these prospects were gone. The port development did not go ahead and the railway that was completed in 1908 bypassed Foxton. Despite this Hornblow and his son Robert managed to keep the Herald running, with Robert taking over as proprietor after his father died in 1937. The paper changed hands several more times before ceasing publication in 1997.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Herald was initially published twice a week then moved to thrice weekly in 1890, back to bi-weekly in 1944 and then weekly from 1956. In 1955 the title was changed to the Foxton Herald and in 1961 it reverted to the Manawatu Herald.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Koia te nūpepa tuatahi i tāngia ki Foxton, i muri i ngā whakamātauranga huakore ki te whakaputa i tētahi nūpepa i huaina te Manawatu Guardian i te tau 1873. Kua mahi kē a George Russell i ētahi nūpepa i Waihopai (Invercargill) me Pōneke, ā, i haere tonu ki ētahi atu mahi ai pērā i te Spectator i Otautahi.

I heipū pea tēnei āhuatanga i te mea hei kanohi a Thynne me te Herald mō te rōpū pōti taiwhenua o Foxton.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1906 ka hokona te nūpepa e Thynne ki a John Knowles Hornblow. Nō tētahi whānau kaituhi nūpepa a Hornblow. I tuhi tōna pāpā mō te New Zealand Times, ko Hornblow rātou ko ana teina hoki i mahi mō ētahi nūpepa i te Wairarapa.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The Mount Ida Chronicle and St Bathans Weekly News was one of the earliest goldfields newspapers to survive for a lengthy period. In May 1863, gold was discovered in the Hogburn Valley, on the Upper Taieri Plain 90 miles north-west of Dunedin, by a party of miners including the Parker brothers. The resulting township had various names – including Parker’s, Hogburn and Mount Ida – before settling on Naseby. The Mount Ida Chronicle was founded there in 1869 by Hugh Wilson who ran the paper with a succession of partners until his retirement in 1919. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first partner was Henry Hertslet, a considerable landowner, whose involvement lasted only a year. Two years later Cecil de Lautour joined the paper as partner and editor, combining his editorial role with an increasing involvement in politics. In 1874, de Lautour was elected as one of the two members to represent the Mount Ida district on the Otago Provincial Council, remaining on it until its abolition in 1876. The same year he was returned as the member for Mt Ida in the House of Representatives, and won two subsequent elections in 1879 and 1881. Cecil de Lautour’s actual involvement with the newspaper ended when he left the district in 1879 and moved to Poverty Bay. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Wilson’s next partner, from 1883, was Mackay J S (Scobie) Mackenzie. A successful runholder, he was also an aspiring politician. After some years on the Maniototo County Council, Mackenzie stood against de Lautour at the 1881 election, challenging the incumbent’s right to represent Mt Ida when he lived hundreds of kilometres away in the North Island. As the Otago Witness reported in Mackenzie’s September 1901 obituary: ‘The contest which ensued had a sensational termination. Telegraphs were rarer in those days, and on the evening of the election it was concluded, in the absence of one or two outlying returns, that Mr Mackenzie was the member for Mount Ida. He was carried in triumph through the streets of Naseby, while his opponent left the town and travelled through the night to catch train and steamer for the north. Before daylight, however, a block vote for Mr de Lautour came in from the largest of the outlying places, and by a few votes the position was reversed.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Scobie Mackenzie was elected to the House of Representatives in 1884, while de Lautour contested an Auckland seat unsuccessfully. Mackenzie was an accomplished journalist, writing regularly for the Mount Ida Chronicle and Australian newspapers. He served three terms as MP for Mount Ida and then held, from 1896-1899, a Dunedin seat. In 1896 his shares in the newspaper were sold to a relation-by-marriage, Alfred Dillon Bell, brother of Sir Francis Bell. John Reed took up the Bell interest in 1907 and ran the business following Wilson’s 1919 retirement until the newspaper’s 1926 sale and subsequent demise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For much of its 57 years, the Mount Ida Chronicle was a weekly. Gold in the area was mined by hydraulic sluicing and the government built several miles of water races in 1875. Following this boost to the local mining industry, the newspaper appeared twice-weekly until 1899. Naseby was the commercial and local government centre of the Maniototo for the last 25 years of the 19th century and by 1880 one of the largest towns in the district, and claiming a population of about 4,000. As well as many hotels, it had the county council chambers, town hall, courthouse, warden’s office, district hospital, several churches and schools, Masonic hall, Athenaeum (library and reading room), and racecourse. However, by the early 1920s, gold mining was finished and, with the Central Otago railway bypassing the town, Ranfurly became the new district centre. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Mount Ida Chronicle provided informed and contrasting political comment during the period Cecil de Lautour and Scobie Mackenzie were writing for it. Before the parliamentary party era, both were independents, but de Lautour was of a liberal and Mackenzie a more conservative persuasion. The paper also provided a detailed coverage of an important period in the country’s gold mining history and was a conscientious recorder of the social life of the Maniototo. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I te tau 1874, ka pōtitia ko de Lautour hei mema i te taha o te mema tuarua i pōtitia mō te rohe o Mount Ida i te Kaunihera ā-Rohe o Ōtākou, ā, ka noho i reira tae noa ki tōna whakakorenga i 1876.

Tērā ngā pūrongo a te Otago Witness i roto i te poroporoaki ki a Mackenzie i te Hepetema 1901: ‘He whakamīharo te whakataetae i whai i muri. Kāore i tino nui ngā tarikarāwhe i aua tau, ā, i te pō o te rā pōtitanga i maharatia, ahakoa kāore anō kia tae mai ētahi o ngā huinga pōti o te tuawhenua, kua wikitōria a Mackenzie ā, koia te mema hou mō Mount Ida. Ka kawea haeretia ia i runga i te rekareka o ngā hoa, mā roto i ngā tiriti o Naseby, ā, ka wehe atu tana hoa tauwhāinga i te tāone, ka haere i te roanga o te pō kia āhei tana piki ki runga tereina, me te tima hoki, kia tae atu ia ki te Ika-a-Māui. Engari i mua i te awatea o muri mai, ka tae mai tētahi huinga pōti nui mō de Lautour mai i ētahi atu o ngā wāhi tino nui o te tuawhenua, me te aha, kua takahuri anō te kaute, kia eke ko de Lautour hei kanohi.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I pōtitia a Scobie Mackenzie ki te Whare Pāremata i te tau 1884, ā, i whakataetae a de Lautour i tētahi tūru i Tāmaki-makau-rau, engari kāore i eke. He kaituhi ringa rehe a Mackenzie ā, he auau tonu tāna tuhi mō te Mount Ida Chronicle me ētahi nūpepa i Āhitereiria. E toru ana tūnga hei Mema Pāremata mō Mount Ida, ā, i puritia tētahi tūnga i Ōtepoti i 1896-1899. I te tau 1896 ka hokona ana hea i te nūpepa ki tētahi whanaunga pākūhā ki a Alfred Dillon Bell, hei teina tēnei ki a Sir Francis Bell. Nā John Reed i hāpai ngā hea o te whānau Bell i te tau 1907 me te whakahaere i te umanga i muri i te hekenga a Wilson i tana tūranga i te tau 1919 taea noatia te hokonga me te mutunga o te nūpepa i te tau 1926. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Mō te roanga atu o ōna tau 57 ka noho te Mount Ida Chronicle hei nūpepa ā-wiki. Ko te puhanga wai te tikanga keri kōura i taua rohe, ā, i hangā hoki e te kāwanatanga ētahi maero terenga wai i te tau 1875. I muri i tēnei whakapikinga i te ahumahi keri kōura ā-rohe, e rua rawa ngā putanga o te nūpepa i te wiki, tae noa mai ki 1899. Ko Naseby tonu te pūtahi o ngā mahi arumoni, kāwanatanga hoki o Maniototo i ngā tau whakamutunga 25 o te rau tau 19. Nō te taenga ki te tau 1880 ka eke hei tāone nui i waenga i ngā tāone o te rohe, ko tōna taupori kua piki ki te 4,000. Kua tū ōna hōtēra maha, tōna hōro tāone hoki, ōna tari kaunihera ā-takiwā, he whare kōti, he tari wātene, he hōhipera ā-rohe, ētahi whare karakia, kura hoki, he hōro Masonic, tētahi Athenaeum (he whare pukapuka, me tōna rūma pānui pukapuka) me te papa reihi hōiho. Ahakoa tēnei, kia tae ki ngā tau tuatahi i muri mai i 1920, kua mutu te mahi keri kōura, kua taha te rerewē o Central Otago i te tāone, ā, ka noho ko Ranfurly te pūtahi hou o te rohe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nā te nūpepa nei nā te Mount Ida Chronicle i hora ētahi whakapuaki whai whakaaro, whakamere hoki i te wā o āna kaituhi, a Cecil de Lautour rāua ko Scobie Mackenzie. I mua atu tēnei i ngā tau o ngā rōpū tōrangapū, nā reira he tangata tū takitahi tēnei tokorua. Heoi anō, he whakaaro ngāwari a de Lautour ā, he āhua mārō kē atu te tū a Mackenzie. He rawe ngā kohinga kōrero mō ngā āhuatanga o aua tau nunui o te keringa kōura i Aotearoa, ā, he pukumahi hoki te nūpepa ki te āta tuhi haere i ngā mahi, i ngā kōrero, i ngā huihuinga a ngā iwi o te rohe o Maniatoto i ōna rā. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

This was the first Maori-language newspaper.&amp;nbsp; The paper ceased being published when war broke out in the north. Altogether there were 50 issues from 1842.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This paper was edited for the government by Hori Karaka (George Clarke), government-appointed Protector of Aborigines, Thomas Spencer Forsaith, a Hokianga settler and shopkeeper who was later appointed Sub-Protector of Aborigines, and Dr Edward Shortland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Hocken, the newspaper promoted the view that &amp;lsquo;the Treaty of Waitangi enfolded both parties to the contract&amp;rsquo; (Otago Daily Times, 20 July 1910, p. 8).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Maori Messenger : Te Karere Maori was published between 1849 and 1854. It was a revival of Te Karere o Nui Tireni and contained similar material. The paper presented issues facing the government and Maori people, essentially from the government viewpoint. Hocken stated that &amp;lsquo;Political and polemical subjects were forbidden, those of general interest and value being alone admitted. Special attention was ... paid to the cultivation of land and flax and the management of sheep and cattle&amp;rsquo; (ibid).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last issue was published in May 1854. The paper was reinstated in a new format nine months later (1855&amp;ndash;1861). It was first edited by Hare Reweti (Charles Davis), who came to Hokianga from New South Wales in the 1830s. He acted initially as a tutor to the children of the Wesleyan missionaries. When the mission was disbanded he moved to Auckland (ibid). Later editors included David Burn and Walter Buller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper was reborn as Te Manuhiri Tuarangi and Maori Intelligencer (Visitor from Afar, March&amp;ndash;November 1861). The editorial in the first issue claimed that the paper was more comprehensive and more widely circulated than previous Messengers. Correspondents in each Maori district were appointed to provide local news.&amp;nbsp; The newspaper&amp;#39;s masthead contained the motto &amp;lsquo;Kia whakakotahitia te Maori me te Pakeha&amp;rsquo; (Let the Maori and Pakeha be united). The first issue stated that the aim of the newspaper is to promote &amp;lsquo;the complete union of the Pakeha and Maori races in New Zealand/ka mau tonu ta matou whakaaro ki te tikanga whakakotahi i te Maori i te Pakeha ki Nui Tirani&amp;rsquo; (1 March 1861: 4).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Te Karere Maori, or, Maori Messenger (1861&amp;ndash;1863) was a continuation of Te Manuhiri Tuarangi (1861) with the same physical format, although the number of pages was reduced and the issues appeared less regularly. The intention of the newspaper and subject coverage were the same as Te Manuhiri Tuarangi. The paper was closed down in September 1863.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For further information about the five different iterations of the newspaper, see P Parkinson and P Griffith, Books in Maori (Auckland: Reed, 2004), S1, S3, S5, S11 and S12, pp. 744&amp;ndash;746, 746&amp;ndash;748, 749&amp;ndash;751, 755&amp;ndash;756, and 757&amp;ndash;758.&amp;nbsp; For further background, see J Curnow, &amp;lsquo;A Brief History of Maori-Language Newspapers&amp;rsquo;, in Rere Atu, Taku Manu! edited by J Curnow, N Hopa and J McRae (Auckland: Auckland University Press, 2002), pp. 17&amp;ndash;41 (pp. 17&amp;ndash;20).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Library would like to thank Gail Dallimore for providing information used in essays about Maori newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Martha Pirani, wife of Frederick, wrote editorials for the paper. Liberal Independent in politics, it circulated in the Manawatu District, Hawke’s Bay and Taranaki and was recognised for its stock sale advertisements. Frederick won the seat of Palmerston in the election of 1893 and remained in office until his retirement due to poor health in 1902. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Manawatu Standard was sold to John Coombe and Norman Henry Nash in 1903.

John Weatherall began the Mt Benger Mail at Roxburgh in 1880.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The Mt Benger Mail was one of a number of newspapers, mostly short-lived, which appeared in Central Otago during the gold rush era in the nineteenth century. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; John Weatherall began the Mt Benger Mail at Roxburgh in 1880. A brief item in the Bruce Herald of 30 April that year announced that the Mt Benger Mail was about to be published ‘at the low price of 3s per quarter’. It also mentioned that John Weatherall was ‘for several years in the Tuapeka Times office’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Gaining a reputation as a ‘rag-planter’ in the region, Weatherall had other forays into newspaper ownership – the Central Otago Leader for one – but was proprietor of the weekly Mt Benger Mail until 1896.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Apparently, Weatherall did not initially own the paper’s press, as the Tuapeka Times reported in November 1883 that John Thompson, auctioneer and Times shareholder, had sold him the plant of the Tuapeka Press (closed in 1869) and Mt Benger Mail for £47 10s (about $8,000 today). The same year Weatherall and journalist James Rowe re-launched the Tuapeka Press as a bi-weekly. It was short-lived, possibly coinciding with Weatherall and Rowe filing for bankruptcy – this remaining in force for about a year. After selling the Mt Benger Mail in 1896, Weatherall began the Tuapeka Recorder (the second paper of that name) in Lawrence and it appears to have survived four years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After he sold the Mt Benger Mail to P J Dunne and William P Matthews, it was reported in the Otago Witness that the new owners had secured new plant, and proposed to remodel the paper. The paper noted: ‘Mr Dunne was for some time on the literary staff of the Waimea Plains Review, and also of the Tuapeka Times, and is regarded as a clever and capable journalist.’ In about 1900 he joined the West Coast Times as editor. He left in 1909, and, moving to the North Island, he subsequently edited the Levin Chronicle and Ohakune Times before dying, aged 55, in 1920. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; William Matthews, who worked on the Otago Daily Times and Australian publications as well as the Tuapeka Times, was proprietor of the Mt Benger Mail when he died in January 1904 and the newspaper was purchased by Mr W Jack of Dunedin. At this time, the weekly, published on Fridays and considered ‘Independent Liberal’ in its politics, contained six, seven-column pages and was circulated widely in Central Otago. The newspaper’s premises contained, as the Cyclopedia of New Zealand reported in 1906: ‘an Albion press, Platen jobbing machine, and a good font of newspaper and jobbing type’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1911 the newspaper was bought by the Tuapeka Times Co and printing shifted to Lawrence. After World War One, in 1919, W A Laloli bought the paper and it was again published in Roxburgh. It became a daily in 1920 for a period. It survived, with reduced frequency, until the early 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The Maoriland Worker is widely considered the most important publication of the New Zealand labour movement. Early in the 20th century the labour movement had two main strands – those wanting revolution and those working for reform and both had publications reflecting their views. Militant trade unionists did not fit easily into either camp. The Shearers’ Union in Christchurch felt the full weight of press condemnation after a 1910 wage dispute and decided to begin their own paper, The Maoriland Worker, as a monthly. The newspaper was produced in Christchurch for a short period, with Ettie Rout and Alexander Wildey prominent. When the shearers’ and miners’ unions combined forces, the paper now represented the ‘Red’ Federation of Labour and, early in 1911, moved its publishing office to Wellington. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The paper, now a weekly, grew rapidly in circulation and influence under the editorship of Australian Bob Ross. It had a circulation of 8,500 by 1912 and 10,000 by the beginning of the next year. It was at the centre of the Federation’s push for socialism. Unionists were enthusiastic ‘paper boys’ and there was a network of voluntary correspondents around the country. The Maoriland Worker’s editorial policy was firmly behind industrial unionism, international co-operation among unionists and pacifism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Maoriland Worker was produced to a high professional standard and included some of the most penetrating political cartoons of the period. Ross had left by 1913, and his replacement, Harry Holland, was later leader of the Labour Party. Holland was charged with sedition for his coverage of a waterfront dispute that snowballed into a general strike late in 1913. He was sentenced to a year in prison, and served a little over three months. When war broke out shortly afterwards, the Maoriland Worker took an uncompromising international socialist position and Holland editorialised that world revolution was at hand. He left the paper in 1918 when elected to Parliament at a by-election. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The weekly continued to express its radical views through the war years and until the early 1920s. During the First World War it struggled with libel costs, censorship and police harassment. In October 1921 The Maoriland Worker carried two poems by the noted British war poet Siegfried Sassoon. Three lines of ‘Stand to: Good Friday Morning’ attracted the attention of the authorities and the paper’s publisher was charged with ‘blasphemous libel’. John Glover was tried in the Supreme Court in 1922, still the only such case in NZ legal history. The trial was held at a time when any dissent was suppressed wherever possible and politicians were preoccupied with maintaining ‘social order’, religion an important component of this. Glover was cleared of the charge, but the jury added a rider to its acquittal noting that the publication of such material should be discouraged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1924, the publication’s name was changed to the New Zealand Worker. The paper’s sub-title also changed. It went from ‘A journal of industrial unionism, socialism and politics’ to ‘A New Zealand paper for New Zealand people’. Although trade unions still funded its publication, control now rested with the Labour Party. The radicalism softened rapidly and substantially as the Labour Party sought electoral respectability. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; E whakaarotia whānuitia ana he putanga hiranga nui te Maoriland Worker ki te kaupapa reipa o Aotearoa. I te tīmatatanga o te rautau rua tekau e rua ngā peka o te kaupapa reipa – ko te hunga e whai ana i te pāhoro, me te hunga e whai ana kia whakahoutia ngā tikanga, i whakaritea hoki e ia rōpū he putanga hei whakaata, hei whakaputa hoki i ō rātou tirohanga ki te ao. Kāore i uru pai ngā kaiuniana kaitaua ki raro i ia o aua karangatanga. Nā te kaha pēhi, whakahē hoki o ngā niupepa i a rātou i muri i tētahi tautohe utu i te tau 1910, i whakatauhia e te Shearers' Union i Ōtautahi kia tīmata i tā rātou ake pepa, Te Maoriland Worker hei putanga ā-marama. I whakaputaina te niupepa i Ōtautahi mō te wā poto, i reira i tino kitea ngā mahi a Ettie Rout me Alexander Wildey. I te whakakotahitanga o te uniana kaikutikuti hipi ki te uniana kaimaina, kua noho te pepa hei kanohi mō te Federation of Labour 'Whero', ā, i te tīmatatanga o 1911, i nekehia tana tari whakaputa ki Te Whanga nui ā-Tara. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I raro i te ētitatanga o Bob Ross nō Ahitereiria, he tere te tipu o te niupepa, he mea whakaputa ā-wiki ināianei, i runga i te nui o ngā kaipānui, i runga hoki i te kaha o tōna awe. I te tau 1912, 8,500 ngā kaipānui, ā, 10,000 i te tīmatatanga o te tau whai muri mai. Me kī ko te pokapū tērā o te Federation mō te akiaki i te mana hapori. E rikarika ana ngā kaiuniana kia tū hei 'paper boy', he whatunga kairīpoata tūao hoki tō rātou puta noa i ngā motu. I te tino taunaki te kaupapahere ētita a te Maoriland Worker i te unianatanga ahumahi, te mahitahitanga a ngā kaiuniana puta noa i te ao, me te whakamārietanga. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I eke ngā tikanga tārei i te Maoriland Worker i runga i tētahi paerewa ngaio teitei tonu, tae atu ki ētahi o ngā pakiwaituhi tōrangapū tīwharawhara hoki o te wā. I wehe atu a Ross i te tau 1913, nō muri mai i whiwhi i tana whakakapi a Harry Holand te tūranga o te kaitātaki o te Labour Party. I hāmenetia a Holland mō te mahi whana kāwanatanga mō tana rīpoata i tētahi tautohenga wāpu i huri hei taraiki whānui i te mutunga o te tau 1913. I whiua a ia ki te kotahi tau i roto whareherehere, engari i mauheretia mō te toru marama noa iho. Nō muri tata i pakaru mai te pakanga, ko te tū a te Maoriland Worker ko te tū a te kaikōkiri mana hapori ā-ao, i puta hoki ngā matapae a Holland i ngā kōrero ētita mō te ekenga o te pāhoro ā-ao. I wehe a ia i te pepa i te tau 1918 i tana pōtitanga ki te Whare Pāremata i tētahi pōtitanga-iti. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He kaha tonu te whakaputa a ngā tirohanga wāwāhi tikanga puta noa i ngā tau o te pakanga tae atu ki ngā tau tuatahi o ngā 1920. I waenga i ngā tau o te pakanga i pēhingia hoki te niupepa e ngā utu kupu whakakino, te aukatinga me te inonotitanga pirihimana. I te tau 1921 i tāngia e te Maoriland Worker ētahi ruri nā te kaitito rongonui Peretania o te pakanga a Siegfried Sassoon. I kitea e ngā mana o te wā ngā raina e toru o 'Stand to: Good Friday Morning’ i hāmenetia te kaiwhakaputa o te pepa mō te 'kupu whakakino kohukohu'. I whakawāhia a John Glover i te Supreme Court i te tau 1922, koira anake te momo kēhi pērā i te hītori ture o Aotearoa. I tū te whakawā i tētahi wā ko te pēhi i te hunga whakararu i ngā wā me ngā wāhi ka taea te mahi, ā, i te aro kē ngā kaitōrangapū ki te pupuritanga o te 'raupapa pāpori', ko te hāhi tētahi wae tino nui o tēnei momo mahi. I wetea a Glover i te whakapae, engari i tāpirihia atu e te tekau mā rua he kōrero ki tana wetenga e kī ana e tika ana kia whakapāhunu i aua momo tuhinga. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1924, i hurihia te ingoa o te putanga ki te New Zealand Worker. I huri hoki te taitara-roto. I huri mai i te kōrero 'He hautaka o te unianatanga ahumahi, te mana hapori me te tōrangapū' ki 'He pepa nō Aotearoa mā ngā tāngata o Aotearoa'. Ahakoa i te whai pūtea tonu te putanga i ngā uniana, i te noho tonu te mana whakahaere i te Rōpū Reipa. He tere, he nui hoki te heke o te mahi wāwāhi tikanga i a te Labour Party e whai ana kia tika tō rātou āhua ā-tōrangapū. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

In 1877 the title changed to the Northern Advocate and General Advertiser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, the Advocate was set up to voice the concerns of Northlanders. Its stated purpose was to redress "the real criminal injustice the northern settlements laboured under from the legislature of the colony".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Advocate quickly established itself. Initially it was issued weekly. It had 12 pages and carried a small section printed in Māori. It probably started daily publication in 1902 in response to the setting up of another newspaper in Whangarei, the Northern Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Advocate had various rivals over the years. In 1891 there was the Kamo and Hikurangi Gazette which probably only lasted a year. A potentially serious competitor emerged in 1902 - the Northern Chronicle. The publisher of this paper was Francis Mander. Mander, the father of the author Jane Mander, was a local MP and businessman. However before the Chronicle got established, Mander acquired the Advocate and closed the Chronicle. For a short time in the 1900s there were two daily newspapers in Whangarei besides the Advocate. These were the Whangarei County Press (1905-1908?) and the Northern Mail (1908-1914?). Whangarei could not support three newspapers and The Press closed down almost immediately. The Mail and the Advocate enjoyed a lively rivalry until 1914 when the owners of the Mail acquired the Advocate. The new owners formed the Northern Advocate Co. and closed the Mail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Advocate is still the daily newspaper in Whangarei.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Nō te tau 1877 ka tīnia te ingoa ki te Northern Advocate and General Advertiser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kei te ingoa o te Advocate tōna kaupapa, arā, he reo mō ngā iwi o Te Taitokerau. Ko tōna kaupapa, he whakatika i 'te kino o te hara i te takakino a te rōpū hanga ture o te taiwhenua i ngā nohanga o Te Taitokerau.'&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ka tere te whakaū a te Advocate i a ia anō. I te tīmatanga he tā ia-wiki. 12 ōna whārangi, he wāhanga iti i te Reo Māori. Nō te tau 1902 pea tōna tānga ia-rā hei whakautu i te whakatūranga o tētahi nūpepa anō i Whangārei, te Northern Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He tāwhai anō o te Advocate i ngā tau. I te tau 1891, ko te Kamo and Hikurangi Gazette he tau kotahi noa tōna tānga. He tāwhainga tūturu ka puta mai i te tau 1902, arā, te Northern Chronicle. Ko Francis Mander te kaitā o tēnei nūpepa. Ko Mander, te pāpā o te kaituhi Jane Mander, te Mema Pāremata o te rohe, he kaipakihi hoki. Ēngari nō mua noa o te whakaūtanga o te Chronicle, ka riro i a Mander te Advocate, ā, ka katia te Chronicle. Mō tētahi wā poto i ngā tau tuatahi atu i 1900 ka rua ngā nūpepa ia-rā i Whangārei tua atu o te Advocate. Koirā te Whangārei County Press (1905 ki te 1908?) me te Northern Mail (1908 ki te 1914?). Kāore i taea e Whangārei te tautoko i ngā nūpepa e toru, ka katia wawe te Press. He kaha te tāwhainga o te Mail me te Advocate tae noa ki te tau 1914, te wā i riro ai te Advocate i ngā rangatira o te Mail. Ka whakatūria e ngā rangatira hou te Northern Advocate Co., ka katia ai te Mail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko te Advocate te nūpepa ia-rā o Whangārei tae noa ki tēnei wā.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Nelson Evening Mail was the first daily newspaper published in Nelson. The first issue came out on 5 March 1866. Robert Lucas, a printer who arrived in Nelson in 1859, started the paper. He had previously published two other, short-lived papers - the Nelson Advertiser (1860) and the Nelson Intelligence (1862).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time the Mail began publication there were already two existing newspapers in Nelson - the Examiner (1842-1873) and the Colonist (1857-1921). The Mail provided strong competition for them. It first forced the papers to go daily and then eventually observed their demise - the Examiner in 1873 and the Colonist in 1921.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then the Mail has been Nelson's only daily newspaper. The Lucas family managed the paper until 1993 when it was sold to INL and its name changed to the Nelson Mail.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle was the first newspaper published in the South Island. It was established by Charles Elliott (1811-1876) in 1842, within a few weeks of the New Zealand Company settlers arriving in Nelson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Examiner, like its contemporary in Wellington, the New Zealand Gazette, was founded with a loan from the New Zealand Company. And even though the loan was paid back within a few years and despite disavowals from Elliott, the paper was always regarded by many colonists as an organ of the Company. Certainly the Examiner expressed very similar views to the Company, particularly concerning representative government for the settlers and it was an unrelenting critic of the colonial administration in Auckland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Thomas Hocken, the Examiner was “esteemed the best of all early New Zealand newspapers, and had eminent colonists as its editors and contributors”. These contributors included prominent politicians such as Alfred Domett, Francis Dillon Bell, Edward Stafford and William Fox.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elliott himself was politically active, holding various offices in the provincial government of Nelson in the 1850’s and 1860’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately the Examiner was unable to compete with the two other Nelson papers, the Colonist and the Nelson Evening Mail. The Examiner was too closely aligned with the interests of the large run-holders in the Wairau, who included Charles Elliott and his brother James. The Colonist was established in 1857 to oppose these landed proprietors. The paper lost much of its support when the Wairau was incorporated into the neighbouring province of Marlborough in 1859.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Examiner tried to compete by moving to daily publication in 1873 and setting up subsidiary publications. These included the Illustrated Examiner (1869), the Weekly Examiner (1873), Wakamarina Intelligencer (1874). None of these publications could be sustained and the paper folded in 1874.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The North Otago Times was first published on 25 February 1864 under the title Oamaru Times and Waitaki Reporter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper was founded by Frank Pinkerton. In 1870 William Jukes Steward was the registered owner and the title was changed to the North Otago Times. Initially the paper had been issued weekly, but in 1876 it began daily publication. This was in anticipation of the setting up of a rival daily, the Oamaru Mail. The rivalry was real but sporting - the Times printed the first issue of the Mail in 1876 when the Mail's equipment failed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mail was started by William Jukes Steward, the local MP, who had previously owned the Times. Steward and some associates probably started the paper to provide a forum for their political views particularly those concerning the abolition of provincial government in New Zealand. Steward was in favour of abolition even though the Otago MPs tended to favour retention of the provincial system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially the Mail struggled against the Times and the paper soon changed hands. However the Mail was given an unexpected boost in 1877, as a result of the new owner George Jones being tried by the House of Representatives for criminal libel for comments printed in the Mail. This was the first state trial ordered by Parliament. Jones was acquitted and gained a reputation as a champion of freedom of the press. The public showed its appreciation by patronising the Mail. Its circulation and advertising rose. The Mail ultimately triumphed over the Times - it is still published whereas the Times ceased in 1932.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Tērā pea, nā Steward, te Mema Pāremata mō te rohe, me ētahi hoa te pepa nei i whakaū hei whakapāho i ō rātou whakaaro tōrangapū, erangi rawa ia ko ērā whakaaro e pā ana ki te whakakorenga i te kāwanatanga porowini i Niu Tīreni.

      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The New Zealander began publishing weekly in Auckland in June 1845. Under competitive pressure it became a bi-weekly in 1847 and by 1859 it had become the leading daily newspaper in New Zealand. However, its pro-Māori policy led to a decline in circulation and it stopped publication in 1866.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
      <Description language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;I tīmata te whakaputa i te New Zealander ia wiki i ākarana i te marama o Pipiri 1845. Nā te kaha o te whakataetae ka puta i ngā rā e rua ki te wiki i te tau 1847, ā, nō te tau 1859 koia te tino nūpepa o ia rā i Aotearoa. Heoi anō, nā tana tautoko ki ngā kaupapa Māori ka kore haere te tukutuku, ā, ka mutu te whakaputaina i te tau 1866.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;John Williamson started the New Zealander as a weekly newspaper in 1845 and it was the main competitor of the Southern Cross. These were the only two newspapers that became established in Auckland for any significant period of time before the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New Zealander began during the depression following the war against Hone Heke in Northland. The paper aimed to represent the interests of the average settler and Māori. It was the view of the New Zealander that the interests of the larger land claimant groups were already receiving more than enough coverage in the Auckland Times. Ironically the Times closed shortly after the New Zealander began publishing in June 1845.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Southern Cross was temporarily suspended in 1845 leaving the New Zealander to continue without competition until the Southern Cross was revived in 1847. The New Zealander responded to this by publishing bi-weekly. In 1848 Williamson took William Chisholm Wilson into partnership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper steadily increased its influence. By 1859 it was the leading paper in New Zealand and in 1863 it became a daily. Also in that year the partnership split over the war against the Māori. Williamson was against it while Wilson was for it. Wilson left to set up the New Zealand Herald and Williamson carried on as the sole owner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New Zealander incurred some criticism for its comments on the war. In June 1864 fifty men from the HMS Esk threatened to pull down the newspaper office after one of the paper's correspondents suggested that Captain Hamilton's death at Gate Pa was due to his men having deserted. Williamson refused to apologise but did offer to print a rebuttal from the seamen in his paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By this time the New Zealander had begun to lose influence and support. The paper's pro-Māori policy was moderated but it was too late. In 1865 it couldn't sustain daily publication and had to revert to bi-weekly. In May 1866 the office burnt down and the paper stopped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New Zealander and the Southern Cross are good examples of the way the country's press was politically aligned at the time and this was mirrored in other centres around New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Nā John Williamson te New Zealander i tīmata hei nūpepa ā-wiki i te tau 1845, koia rā te nūpepa tino whakataetae i te Southern Cross. Ko ēnei noa iho ngā nūpepa i tū i ākarana mō tētahi wā i mua o te tau 1860.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tīmata te New Zealander i te wā o te toimahatanga nō muri mai o te pakanga ki a Hone Heke i te Taitokerau. Ko tā te nūpepa he whakaatu i ngā take o te tangata whai pānga iti me te Māori. Ki te New Zealander he kaha tonu te whakapāohotanga o ngā whai pānga a ngā rōpū rapu whenua nui atu e te Auckland Times. Inā te korokē, nō muri tata noa mai o te tīmatanga ki te whakaputa i te New Zealander i te marama o Pipiri 1845, ka katia ai te Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ka whakatārewatia te Southern Cross i te tau 1845, tukua ana te New Zealander kia haere kore whakataetae tae noa ki te tau 1847, arā, te tau o te whakaaranga ake o te Southern Cross. E rua whakaputanga ki te wiki te whakautu a te New Zealander. I te tau 1848, ka tīkina e Williamson ko William Chisholm Wilson hei hoa kaipakihi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ka tupu haere te whaimana o te nūpepa. Tae rawa ana ki te tau 1859 koia te tino nūpepa o Aotearoa, ā, i te tau 1863 ka puta ia rā, ia rā. I taua tau anō ka raru te hoa pakihi i te pakanga ki te Māori. Kīhai a Williamson i tautoko, ēngari a Wilson. Ka wehe atu a Wilson ki te whakatū i te New Zealand Herald, ka noho tonu a Williamson anahe hei rangatira.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ka whakahēngia te New Zealander i āna whakapuakitanga mō te pakanga. I te marama o Pipiri i te tau 1864 ka whakawehia mai e rima tekau o ngā heremana mai i te HMS Esk ki te turaki i te tari o te nūpepa nō muri mai o te puakitanga e tētahi o ngā kairīpoata a te nūpepa nā te whakarerenga o āna hōia i mate ai a Kāpene Hamilton i Pukehinahina. Kīhai a Williamson i whakapāha, ēngari i tukua kia tāngia ki tana nūpepa ētahi kupu tātā mai i ngā heremana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ki tēnei wā ka kore haere te tautoko mai me te whaimana o te New Zealander. Ka whakatūpatotia te tauawhi kaupapa Māori, ēngari taea te pēwhea. Tae noa ki te tau 1865 kāore i taea te whakaputa ia rā, ka hoki kē ki ngā putanga e rua ia wiki. I te marama o Haratua i te tau 1866 nō te kānga o te tari i te ahi, ka kore te nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He tauira pai te New Zealander me te Southern Cross o te ū a ngā nūpepa o te motu ki te tōrangapū i taua wā, ā, he pērā rā anō ki ētahi atu tāone o Aotearoa. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Advertiser is a significant New Zealand newspaper. It was New Zealand’s second earliest newspaper. It was a forerunner to the Government Gazette as it was used by the colonial administration to publish official notices. The Advertiser also was effectively suppressed by the government for criticising its policy on land.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Advertiser was published in Kororareka from June to December 1840 and ran for twenty-seven issues. It was printed by G. A. Eager and edited by the Rev. Barzillai Quaife.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper owed its existence to the government who used it as their gazette. While this was its primary function the newspaper also represented settler opinion, particularly concerning land claims. On this issue Quaife was critical of the colonial administration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government responded by invoking anti-press laws instituted in New South Wales in 1827 (New Zealand, at this stage was subject to New South Wales law). The cost of complying with these laws was more than the paper could bear and it suspended publication in December 1840. It seems clear that this is what the government intended. The anti-press laws had hardly been enforced and compliance was required only after Quaife started criticising the government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On 30 December 1840 the Government began publishing its own gazette. In the first issue it was claimed that the Advertiser was no longer being used for government notices because the newspaper had declined to publish them. This was greeted with disbelief by settlers, who found it hard to accept that the newspaper would turn down the very business that sustained it. The government copped much criticism for its actions from the New Zealand Gazette, New Zealand’s other newspaper at the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;History repeated itself in 1842 when Quaife went on to edit another newspaper, the Bay of Islands Observer. He continued to criticise government policy on land and the government responded by effectively putting him out of business, although this time with threats of libel actions. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I whakaputahia te nūpepa nei hei whakataetae ki te New Zealand Gazette i tīmata ai te whakaputa i te tau 1839 i tū hoki hei tino kaitautoko o te Kamupene o Niu Tīreni (New Zealand Company).&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Colonist and Port Nicholson Advertiser illustrates the factionalism and divergent interests of the early Wellington colonial community. The newspaper was published to counter the New Zealand Company's New Zealand Gazette.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gazette had been established in August 1839 by Samuel Revans who was a staunch friend and advocate of the Company. The Gazette's editorial policy was extremely pro-Company. Revans believed that serving the interests of the Company would also serve the interests of the settlement and the settlers. To this end he deliberately censored anti-Company opinions. His championing of the Company became increasingly unpopular as the settlers' and the Company's views and interests diverged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gazette's factional and increasingly anti-settler position eventually led to a group of fifty local merchants and landowners establishing a rival paper, the New Zealand Colonist. It started in August 1842 and was published bi-weekly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the Colonist was intended to be opposition for the Gazette it took a strongly anti-Gazette and pro-settler editorial position. However the Colonist struggled financially from the beginning and its position was made more difficult by lack of support from the Company, which was one of the main sources of revenue in the fledgling colony.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Colonist stopped publication exactly a year after it began, mainly due to poor sales combined with a ruinous fire in its Lambton Quay office. Patrick Day (The Making of the New Zealand Press, 1990) says that "the failure of the small settlement to support a second newspaper against the established Gazette deprived Wellington of an able and largely disinterested voice."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revans soon fell out with the Company and, growing bored with the venture, closed the New Zealand Gazette in September 1844.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

He tino tautoko tā te kaupapa ētita ki taua Kamupene. I tino whakapono a Revans mā te whai atu i ngā hiahia a te Kamupene e whai atu ai hoki i ngā hiahia o te tāone hōu me Hōpara i ngā pānuitangata whai. Mai i tēnei ka aukatihia e ia ngā whakaaro whakahē ki te Kamupene.

The publishers split the title, with the Auckland paper becoming the NZ Observer and the Wellington paper taking the name Free Lance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite its initial association with the Observer, the Free Lance soon developed as a separate publication with the Geddis family concentrating on the Free Lance and Blomfield the Observer. The editor James McRobert Geddis (1856-1935) later became sole proprietor and in 1920 the Geddis family formed a private company to run the paper. The Geddis family were involved with the management of the Free Lance until it was incorporated into the New Zealand Weekly News in 1960. Its demise left the Weekly News as the last pictorial weekly in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Free Lance was a typical weekly; conservative and mainstream with much coverage given to royalty, New Zealand scenery, high society and sport. It was noted for its political cartoons. It carried the work of some of the country’s top cartoonists including John Gilmour, Gordon Minhinnick, Tom Ellis (Tom Glover), E.F. Hiscocks and Stuart Peterson. The Free Lance was fortunate to begin publishing at the same time as there was a flowering of local cartooning talent. The Free Lance not only benefited from this but also played a significant role in fostering this talent and pictorial journalism in general.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The new daily had a clear editorial policy – a more constructive relationship between the North and South Islands and a combative response to what it termed ‘the native rebellion’ – but Wilson’s main motivation was commercial, seeing a business opportunity as Auckland’s population grew rapidly. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although the New Zealander closed in 1866, the Daily Southern Cross provided competition for a number of years, and particularly when Julius Vogel acquired a majority shareholding in 1868. In 1876, Alfred Horton, a journalist and printer by training, sold his interest in the Thames Advertiser and bought Vogel’s then-ailing Daily Southern Cross. Shortly afterwards William Wilson died and the next year Horton and Wilson’s two sons merged their interests - the stronger mastheads surviving. The New Zealand Herald absorbed the Daily Southern Cross and its Weekly News incorporated the Weekly Herald. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; By the late 1870s the Auckland newspaper scene was dominated by the New Zealand Herald, in the morning, and the Auckland Evening Star (later Auckland Star) at night. The New Zealand Herald was consistently conservative; the Evening Star supported the liberal political movement that was beginning to gain ground. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alfred Horton’s interest in fast-changing newspaper technology led to Wilson and Horton’s installation of the country’s first rotary press at the New Zealand Herald in 1883. This was followed by a web machine in 1887 and linotypes in 1898. It was also the first local newspaper, in 1909, to run classified advertisements, with products and services sorted in categories. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Horton also played a part in the founding of the NZ Press Association in 1878, which began to share local news among newspaper members and to channel news received from overseas. A year later he assisted in resolving problems with a rival news agency that led to the two joining forces as the United Press Association. The name changed back again to New Zealand Press Association in 1942. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For decades the New Zealand Herald changed little in its appearance and sober, right-of-centre editorial stance; this was epitomised for half a century by the generally conservative cartoons of Gordon Minhinnick. The sobriquet ‘Granny Herald’ was part affection, part frustration. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The New Zealand Herald became a public company in 1925, but a majority shareholding was retained, along with all the directorships, by the Wilson and Horton families. In 1996 the Dublin-based Independent News &amp; Media Group bought the Horton family’s shareholding. The paper is now owned by Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN), a subsidiary of Independent News &amp; Media. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

A number of titles, including Zealandia (1889), Citizen (1895), Critic (1899), were published in various cities. None of them met with much success or lasted for any length of time.

It is interesting to speculate as to why the New Zealand public preferred the imported varieties to the local. Perhaps the reading public was not as nationalistic as publishers thought they were and found that English and Australian periodicals represented their views as well or better than the indigenous magazines. It is also likely that the New Zealand periodicals suffered from competition with local newspapers, particularly the illustrated weeklies such as the Free Lance and Weekly News. These weekly papers had similar content to periodicals like the Illustrated Magazine and were well established by the late nineteenth century and very popular with the public.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Spectator was the first Wellington newspaper to last for any length of time. It began weekly publication in October 1844, several weeks after the demise of the New Zealand Gazette, Wellington’s and New Zealand’s first newspaper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Spectator was set up by a committee of local settlers to fill the gap left by the Gazette and to provide an alternative to it. The Gazette, a New Zealand company newspaper under the editorship of Samuel Revans, had been so vociferous in its attacks on the colonial administration that many settlers wanted a newspaper that was more temperate. However the Spectator soon found itself embroiled in conflict, when the paper’s printers published an item from Revans that was clearly an attack on local lawyer Daniel Wakefield (younger brother of Edward Gibbon Wakefield). The publishers dismissed the printers who responded by setting up a rival newspaper, the Wellington Independent. The Spectator immediately tried to put the Independent out of business by taking back the printing plant that they were using. The Independent got its own equipment and was back in business four months later. The Spectator and the Independent warred continually for years, advocating for opposing parties in local, provincial and national politics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From 1845 to 1858 the Spectator was published in Manners Street at the printing works of Robert Stokes (c.1810-80). Stokes was a member of the committee that set up the Spectator. He had originally come to Wellington in 1840 as a New Zealand Company surveyor. He was involved for many years in provincial and national politics, including being a member of Legislative Council from 1862 to 1879.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stokes was the virtual owner of the paper from about 1850. Under his management the Spectator was the only paper, other than the New Zealander, that supported George Grey and the colonial administration. Many settlers saw Stoke’s support for Grey as grovelling, motivated by a desire to ingratiate himself with the Colonial Office. For this he was described as a "scribbly toady".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Spectator always struggled to keep afloat and in 1865 it allowed itself to be taken over by its rival the Independent.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I tīmata te tānga ā-wiki i a Whiringa-ā-nuku 1844, i ētahi wiki maha tonu i muri mai o te matenga o te New Zealand Gazette, tō Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara me tō Niu Tireni nūpepa tuatahi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I whakatūria te Spectator e tētahi komiti o te hunga whai whenua, hei whakakapi i te āputa i mahue i te Gazette, hei nūpepa rerekē hoki. Ko te Gazette ia, he nūpepa a te Kamupene o Niu Tireni i raro i te takatānga o Samuel Revans, kua tino keakea rawa āna huaki ki te kāwanatanga tuawhenua, ā, ko te mutunga iho, kua pīrangi kē te maha o te hunga whai whenua i tētahi nūpepa āhua ngāwari kē ake.

Ka panaia ngā kaiwhakatā e ngā kaiwhakaputa, nā, ko te urupare a ēnei ko te whakatū i tētahi nūpepa tāwhai, te Wellington Independent. I whakamātau wawe tonu te Spectator ki te whakamate i te Independent mā te tangonga i ngā mīhini whakatā i te whakamahia e rātou. Ka hokona e te Independent āna ake mīhini, ā, i te mahi anō e whā marama i muri mai. Ka whawhai tonu te Spectator me te Independent mō ētahi tau maha, me te tautoko i ngā rōpū ātete mō ngā take tōrangapū ā-kāinga, ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mai i te tau 1845 ki te tau 1858 i whakaputaina te Spectator i te Tiriti o Manners, i te umanga whakatā a Robert Stokes (1810 pea ki te 1880). Ko Stokes tētahi mema o te komiti nāna te Spectator i whakatū. I tae tuatahi mai ia ki Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara i te tau 1840 hei kairūri whenua mō te Kamupene o Niu Tireni. He maha ngā tau i whai wāhi ia ki ngā mahi tōrangapū ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki, tae noa ki tana tūnga hei mema o te Whare Pāremata mai i te tau 1862 ki te tau 1879.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko Stokes te rangatira matua o te nūpepa mai i te takiwā o te tau 1850. I raro i tāna whakahaere, ko te Spectator anake te nūpepa, hāunga te New Zealander, i tautoko i a George Grey rātou ko te kāwanatanga tuawhenua. I kitea te tautoko a Stokes e te maha noa o te hunga whai whenua hei koropiko whakapatipati, he mea whakaoho e tana tāwhai kia āta manakohia e te Tari Tuawhenua. Nā reira i whakaahuatia ia hei "kaieneene tuhituhi kōkau".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ngā wā katoa i ngana te Spectator kia rewa tonu ana mahi, nāwai, i te tau 1865 ka whakaae kia taumanutia e tōna hoa tāwhai, e te Independent.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The NZ Tablet was a Catholic periodical that was published weekly in Dunedin from 1873 to 1996. It was set up to represent the interests of Irish Catholics throughout the nation. The Tablet was, particularly in its first fifty years or so, one of the most significant religious and political journals published in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tablet was founded by Patrick Moran, the first Catholic bishop of Dunedin. Moran was an articulate but vitriolic polemicist on behalf of Irish Catholics. His outspoken criticism of the government &amp;ndash; over the secularisation of education, which he saw as part of an international conspiracy against the Church, and the failure to fund Catholic schools &amp;ndash;attracted national attention but alienated many, including the majority of the press. The Tablet was established to provide him with an alternative means to express his views; Moran often edited the paper and was a regular contributor to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moran was a staunch supporter of Irish nationalism and he ensured that the Tablet gave this cause much coverage. In fact there are indications that he sometimes regarded Irish issues as more important than Catholic ones; in the 1880s he criticised the Vatican for not supporting Irish nationalism as strongly as he thought they should.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Moran had many commendable qualities, his views and the vehemence with which he expressed them were divisive and served to separate Catholics from the wider community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Moran&amp;rsquo;s death in 1895, the Tablet pursued a more moderate line with Henry Cleary as the editor. Cleary, who was in charge from 1898 to 1908, favoured a much more conciliatory approach and he distanced the magazine from the cause of Irish nationalism. In 1918, ten years after leaving the Tablet, Cleary founded the Month, a moderate Catholic journal, to oppose the Tablet, which under James Kelly had returned to the strident approach of Moran.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kelly became the editor of the Tablet in 1917. He was probably even more outspoken on Irish issues than Moran. Kelly was a supporter of Sinn Fein and used the Tablet to promote their cause. His support for Irish nationalism and the anti-English comments he made in the Tablet during the war offended many New Zealanders. These were a factor in the rise of the Howard Elliott and the Protestant Political Association, a sectarian organisation that enjoyed widespread support throughout NZ during the war and through the 1920s. Kelly&amp;rsquo;s style became more bitter and fractious as the years went by and he was forced to resign as editor in 1931.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tablet continued to be a prominent and often outspoken advocate for Catholic and Irish issues after Kelly but it did this in less strident and provocative ways. The Tablet remained an influential periodical, particularly under the editorship of John Kennedy, editor from 1967 to 1989. He was well known as a political commentator and some believe his support for the Labour party in 1972, expressed through the Tablet, was important in their election as the government that year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tablet wound up in April 1996.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Nā āna kaha whakahē ā-waha i te kāwanatanga – mō te meatanga a te kāwanatanga i te mātauranga hei mea nō te whai ao, ki tāna titiro he wāhi hoki tēnei o tētahi kara ki te Hāhi huri noa te ao, mō te hinganga hoki a te kāwanatanga hei utu i ngā kura Katorika – i hakahaka ai te whakaaro o te motu, ēngari nāna anō i whakawehe i te nuinga, uru ana hoki te nuinga o te hunga tā nūpepa. I whakaūtia ai te Tablet kia whiwhi ia i tētahi huarahi kē hei whakapuaki i ōna whakaaro; he nui ngā wā nā Moran te nūpepa i whakatikatika, ā, koia anō tētahi o ngā kaituhi auau ki reira.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He kaitautoko kaha a Moran o te wawao whenua o Airangi, ā, i āta tirohia e ia kia kapia nuitia ai e te Tablet tēnei take. He tika tonu te whakaatu mai, i whakaarohia e ia he mea hira rawa ngā take o Airangi i ō ngā Katorika; i te tekau tau mai i 1880, i whakahēngia e ia te Watikana (Vatican) nōtemea kīhai i kaha tō rātou tautoko i te wawao whenua o Airangi pērā ki tōna i whakaaro ai.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahakoa he maha ngā pai o Moran hei whakamihi, he mea whakawehewehe ōna whakaaro me te kaha o tana whakapuaki i aua whakaaro, ā, koia anō te whakawehe atu i ngā Katorika i te hapori whānui. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nō muri mai i te matenga o Moran i te tau 1895, he āhua ngāwari te huarahi i whaia e te Tablet i a Henry Cleary te takatā. I pai kē a Cleary, nāna hoki i whakahaere mai i te tau 1898 ki 1908, kia āhua tāpore kē te haere, ā, meinga ana e ia kia tawhiti atu te hautaka i te take o te wawao whenua o Airangi. I te tau 1918, arā, tekau tau i muri o tana wehenga atu i te Tablet, i whakaūtia e Cleary te Month, he nūpepa Katorika āhua ngāwari, hei tautohenga ki te Tablet, tērā kua hoki i raro i a James Kelly ki te āhua whakahaere pākinakina o Moran. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I meinga ko Kelly te takatā mō te Tablet i te tau 1917. Tērā pea, he kaha kē ia i a Moran hei waha kōrero mō ngā take o Airangi. Hei kaitautoko a Kelly i a Sinn Fein, ā, i whakamahia e ia te Tablet hei whakatairanga i tō rātou take. Nā tana tautoko i te wawao whenua o Airangi me āna kōrero matakēkē i ngā Ingarihi i roto i te Tablet i waenganui i te Pakanga, nā konei i weriweri ai ētahi tāngata maha o Aotearoa. Ko ēnei hoki tētahi take mō te rewanga o Howard Elliot me te Rōpū Porotehana Tōrangapū, he whakahaerenga rōpū wehe i tautokona whānuitia huri noa Aotearoa i waenganui i ngā tau o te Pakanga me te tekau tau mai i 1920. Ka kaha pūkawa haere, ka kaha whakawehewehe hoki te āhua o Kelly i te haerenga o ngā tau, nā wai ka ākina ia kia tukua te tūru takatā i te tau 1931. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I haere tonu te Tablet hei māngai matua, hei waha kōrero hoki mō ngā take Katorika me ngā take o Airangi i muri i a Kelly, ēngari i āhua ngāwari kē āna mahi, kāore i kaha pākinakina, i taunanawe rānei pērā i mua rā. I noho anō te Tablet hei hautaka whakaawe tonu, motuhake i te wā o John Kennedy, te takatā mai i te tau 1967 ki 1989. I mōhiotia whānuitia ia hei kaikōrero tōrangapū, ā, e whakapono ana ētahi ko āna tautoko mō te Rōpū Reipa i te tau 1972, i whakapuakina i roto i te Tablet, tētahi take nui i tō rātou pōtitanga hei kāwanatanga i tērā tau.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I whakamutua te Tablet i te marama o Paenga-whāwhā 1996. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The NZ Truth was for many years one of the country’s most colourful, controversial and popular newspapers. The Truth was launched, in Wellington, by the Australian newspaper publisher John Norton in June 1905. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Norton owned a stable of Truth newspapers in Australia, starting with the Sydney Truth in 1896. The Sydney Truth’s mix of radical politics and muck-raking proved very popular and Norton established similar papers in the other states before crossing the Tasman. In New Zealand he stuck with the same formula and achieved the same results. By 1930 the Truth was selling 100,000s of copies each week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Truth stood out from the other New Zealand newspapers because it was overtly political and reported the unseemly aspects of life in immoderate prose. Under Robert Hogg, editor from 1913 to 1922, the paper was strongly socialist. It supported the revolutionary Industrial Workers of the World during the 1913 general strike, opposed conscription during the World War One and published letters from pacifist Archibald Baxter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Truth’s politics moved right-wards in the 1920s after John Norton’s son Ezra assumed control. Hogg was dismissed and the paper took a more conservative and populist line from which it never deviated, attacking liberal causes with alacrity. However the commitment to investigative journalism and exposing political corruption remained. The paper was responsible for some major scoops in the next few decades. The Truth grew in popularity although not respectability, circulation reaching about 240,000 copies a week in the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ezra Norton sold the Truth to a consortium of local businessmen in 1951. In 1978 Independent Newspapers acquired the paper and in 1982 they moved it to Auckland. Here the paper went into a sharp decline. Tabloid journalism was now the norm and the paper lost the vitality that being at the centre of politics had given it. Weekly sales were down to 12,500 when the paper was sold in 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Note: no issues are known to exist of the first year of the NZ Truth. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Nō ngā tau maha ko te NZ Truth tētahi o ngā tino nūpepa tautohetohe o te motu. Nā te kaitā nūpepa nā John Norton o Ahitereiria te Truth i whakamāunu i Pōneke i te Hune o 1905. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nā Norton te huinga nūpepa Truth i Ahitereiria, ko tōna tīmatanga mai i te Sydney Truth i Poihākena i te 1896. Ko tā te Sydney Truth kawe i te tuwhena tōrangapū me te kawe whawhewhawhe he mea ihiihi ki te iwi, ā, ka tūria ai e Norton ētahi nūpepa pērā puta noa ngā wehenga, kātahi ka whakawhiti mai Te Tai o Rehua. Ki Aotearoa ko tāna ko taua tū āhuatanga anō, ko aua hua anō. Tae noa ki te 1930, e hia nei ngā raumano kape o te Truth i te hokona. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He mea rerekē atu te Truth i ētahi anō o ngā nūpepa o Aotearoa, te take he mea whakakite tōrangapū, ka tāngia hoki ngā mea anuanu o te wā ki ngā kupu haere hāngai tonu. I raro i a Robert Hogg, te etita mai i te 1913 ki te 1922, he kaha te ā-pāpori o te nūpepa. He mea tautoko i te rōpū whakawhana o ngā Industrial Workers of the World i te wā o te taraika whānui o te 1913, he mea tohe i te māperetanga o te Pakanga ā-Ao Tuatahi, he mea tā i ngā reta mai i te kairongomau, i a Archibald Baxter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ka huri whakatekatau te tōrangapū o te Truth i ngā 1920, nō te rironga o te whakahaeretanga i te tama a John Norton, i a Ezra. Ka panaia atu a Hogg, ka huri, ka mau te nūpepa ki te tūpato, me te manako ā-iwi, ka kaha tonu te tohea o ngā take tōrangapū ngāwari. He oti rā, ka mau tonu tāna here ki te āta rangahau ā-nūpepa me te whakaraerae i te hēnga. Nāna ētahi whakaputanga nui whakaharahara i roto i ngā tekautau o muri mai. Ka tupu, ka tupu te manako ā-iwi, ēngari mō te tirohanga ki te whāia o te tika, ko te hokonga ka eke ki te 240,000 ngā kape i tētahi wiki kotahi i ngā 1960. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ka hokona te Truth e Ezra Norton ki tētahi rōpū kaipakihi o te takiwā i te 1951. Nō te 1978 ka riro te nūpepa i a Independent Newspapers, ā, nō te 1982, ka nukuhia ai ki Ākarana. Nō konei ka tere heke te nūpepa.

      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;It is thought that the Oamaru Mail (first called the Evening Mail) began in order to express opposing views to those being expounded in the North Otago Times about the abolition of the New Zealand provincial system.

      <Description language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;E ai ki ngā mea mōhio i tīmataria te Oamaru Mail (i karangatia ko te Evening Mail i tōna tuatahitanga) hei hoa tauwhāinga ki ngā whakaaro i kauwhautia ai i roto i te North Otago Times mō te whakakorenga i te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-porowini o Aotearoa. I tautoko a William J Steward i te whakakorenga o te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-porowini. Koia te tangata nāna te North Otago Times i waenga i ngā tau 1870 me 1897, otirā, arā hoki ana hoa i roto i te nūpepa i ētahi o aua tau.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; It is thought that the Oamaru Mail (first called the Evening Mail) began in order to express opposing views to those being expounded in the North Otago Times about the abolition of the New Zealand provincial system. William J Steward, who owned the North Otago Times between 1870 and 1897, at times in partnership with others, supported the abolition of the provincial system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Steward was a Member of Parliament for the single-seat Waitaki electorate from 1871-1875, but lost the next election to two provincialists in the then, two-seat electorate. He returned to Parliament in 1881 and was Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1891-1893. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Because there was considerable support for the provincial system, particularly in the far south of the country, a group of prominent Oamaru residents decided they would begin a new daily newspaper to promote this, which they did in April 1876. However, the North Otago Times, first as the bi-weekly Oamaru Times and Waitaki Reporter, then as a tri-weekly, became a daily at the beginning of January 1876, pre-empting the new opposition by three months. Further, there was an inauspicious launch for the Evening Mail when its second-hand machinery broke down. As often happened in the early days of newspapering in New Zealand, the North Otago Times obliged by printing its rival’s first issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was doubtful whether Oamaru’s small population could support two dailies. The township had been surveyed as recently as 1860 and it grew slowly as an agricultural/pastoral service centre until, with the construction of a breakwater in the early 1870s, it became a major port for the region. Certainly, the Evening Mail found the going hard and in early 1877, the provincial system now legislated out of existence, the original Evening Mail Company was wound up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At this point George Jones arrived in Oamaru, following his founding of and brief association with the Evening News in Dunedin, and bought the paper. Born in New Zealand but apprenticed in Australia, Jones was printer of the Auckland Star before launching the Waikato Times in 1872 and the short-lived Echo in Auckland two years later. It took a cause célèbre to put the Evening Mail on a firmer financial footing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1877 the paper accused politician Sir Frederick Whitaker of having a personal interest in native land his planned legislation would make available for sale. Jones was summoned to the bar of the House of Representatives and then prosecuted for criminal libel. He was acquitted, the legislation withdrawn and the Ministry defeated shortly afterwards. The Evening Mail had successfully underscored the ‘freedom of the press’ principle and the attendant publicity provided the paper with a surge of reader and advertiser support. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Oamaru Mail, as it was now called, could afford to take up, with other evening papers, a special telegraphic service originated by the Dunedin Evening Star and was one of the early papers outside metropolitan areas to install linotype machines. In 1909 the Oamaru Mail business was formed into a private company, at about the same time as George Jones bought the Southland News. He and his sons continued to play a prominent part in the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jones also had a lengthy political career. He briefly represented Waitaki in the House of Representatives in the early 1880s and was a member of the Legislative Council for a quarter century from 1895. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to the Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Otago &amp; Southland Provincial Districts] in 1905: ‘The first edition of the ‘Mail’ is published daily at 3 p.m., and is timed for despatch by various trains. The journal is a four page paper of twenty-eight columns, and has a daily circulation of 2,100 copies throughout the North Otago and South Canterbury districts. The ‘Oamaru Mail’ office is centrally situated in Tyne Street. It is a two-storey stone building, which was erected for the domicile of the paper. A water motor, supplied from the corporation water works, and a gas engine drive the plant, which consists of a two-feeder double royal Wharfdale machine, two Platen machines, three linotypes, and other up-to-date appliances, besides an ancient machine on which, it is said, the first issue of the ‘Melbourne Age’ was printed and also the first issue of the ‘Otago Daily Times’.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Oamaru Mail was owned by descendants of the Jones family until the 1970s when it was bought by NZ News Ltd, a Brierley subsidiary, then by Wilson and Horton which, in turn, was sold to APN NZ Media. In November 2011, the Oamaru Mail became a five-mornings-a-week tabloid paper. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 2013, the Oamaru Mail was bought by a private, family-owned Christchurch company, Mainland Media Ltd. The company also bought the Christchurch Star and six other community newspapers in the greater Christchurch area previously owned by APN. Charlotte Smulders, co-owner with her husband, is a member of the Smith family which controls Allied Press and the Otago Daily Times. The Oamaru Mail has a paid circulation of about 2,900 copies.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; E ai ki ngā mea mōhio i tīmataria te Oamaru Mail (i karangatia ko te Evening Mail i tōna tuatahitanga) hei hoa tauwhāinga ki ngā whakaaro i kauwhautia ai i roto i te North Otago Times mō te whakakorenga i te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-porowini o Aotearoa. I tautoko a William J Steward i te whakakorenga o te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-porowini. Koia te tangata nāna te North Otago Times i waenga i ngā tau 1870 me 1897, otirā, arā hoki ana hoa i roto i te nūpepa i ētahi o aua tau. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He mema Pāremata a Steward mō te tūru takitahi o Waitaki mai i 1871-1875, engari i hinga i roto i te pōti whai i muri ki ētahi toa tokorua nō te porowini mō te tūru, kua tūru takirua hoki i taua wā. Ka hoki ia ki te Pāremata i te tau 1881 ā, koia te Kaikōrero i te Whare Pāremata mai i 1891-1893. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nā te mea he nui te tautoko mō te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-rohe, otirā ko te rohe tino whaka-te-tonga o Aotearoa te rohe kaha ki te whakaaro pērā, ka whakatau tētahi rōpū tāngata mana-nui i Oamaru ki te tīmata i tētahi nūpepa o ia rā ki te whakatairanga i taua whakaaro, ā, ka pērā anō i te marama o Āperira 1876. Ahakoa rā, ka tīmata wawe te North Otago Times, hei nūpepa o ia rā i te tīmatanga o 1876, e toru marama i mua i te hoa tauwhāinga. I mua he nūpepa e rua ana putanga i te wiki, ko te ingoa ko Oamaru Times and Waitaki Reporter, ā, i muri e toru ana putanga i te wiki, ka huri hei nūpepa o ia rā. I tua atu i tērā, i aituā te whakarewanga o te Evening Mail i te pakarutanga o ana mīhini kua hokona mai i ētahi atu nūpepa. Rite tonu ki te mahi a te tini o ngā nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa, i whakaae tana hoa tauwhāinga te North Otago Times ki te tā i te putanga tuatahi o tana hoa tauwhāinga. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ki te whakaaro ake kāore pea te taupori o Oamaru i rahi kia ora ngā nūpepa e rua. Nō nakua noa nei te tāone i rūritia ai i te tau 1860, ā, i āta tupu hei pūtahi ahuwhenua, taea noatia te hanganga o tētahi kawa wahapū i ngā tau tuatahi mai i 1870, i piki ai te tāone hei wahapū matua mō te rohe. Arā, he uaua te huarahi mā te Evening Mail ā, i te tau 1877 ka whakamutua te Evening Mail Company. Kua whakakorea hoki te pūnaha kāwanatanga ā-porowini i raro i te ture i taua wā. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I konei ka tae mai a George Jones ki Oamaru, i muri i tana whakatūranga i te Evening News i Ōtepoti, me te hoko i te nūpepa. I whānau mai i Aotearoa, engari i ākona ki tana mahi i Āhitereiria. He kaitā a Jones mō te Auckland Star i mua i tana whakarewanga i te Waikato Times i te tau 1872 me te Echo i Tāmaki-makau-rau e rua tau i muri mai. Nā tētahi take nui whakahirahira ngā pūtea o te Evening Mail i whakamōmona. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1877 ka whakapae te pepa he pānga tō te kaitōrangapū rongonui a Sir Frederick Whitaker ki ngā whenua Māori meāke ka whakawāteatia mō te hoko i raro i āna ture hou. Ka ngarea a Jones ki te pae whakawā o te Whare Pāremata, kātahi ka hāmenetia mō te hāhani nanakia i te ingoa pai o te tangata. Ka kīia he hara-kore ia, me te aha, ka tangohia te pire, ka hinga hoki te Kāwanatanga i muri tata tonu iho. Kua whakaūngia te mātāpono o te 'noho wātea o te perehi ki te mahi i tana mahi' e te Evening Mail ā, ka piki tōna mana i waenga i te iwi, me te tautoko mai anō hoki o ngā kaipānui me ngā kaiwhakatairanga. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kua wātea te Oamaru Mail, (tana ingoa hōu), ki te tīmata i tētahi ratonga tarikarāwhe i takea mai i te Dunedin Evening Star ā, koia tētahi o ngā nūpepa tuatahi i waho i ngā tāone nunui kia whakauru mai i ngā mīhini linotype. I te tau 1909 ka whakapūmautia te umanga o te Oamaru Mail hei kamupene tūmataiti, i te wā tonu i hoko a George Jones i te Southland News. I haere tonu ā rātou mahi hihiri ko ana tama i roto i te kamupene. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He roa tonu hoki te wā o Jones i roto i ngā mahi tōrangapū. Ka uru ia hei kanohi mō te Whare Pāremata mō te tūnga o Waitaki i ngā tau tuatahi o te Whare Pāremata o ngā tau tuatahi mai i 1880 ā, he mema hoki nō te Kaunihera Hanga Ture mō te rua tekau tau mai i 1895. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; E ai ki te Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Otago &amp; Southland Provincial Districts] i 1905: ‘Puta ai te putanga tuatahi o te ‘Mail’ ia rā, ia rā hei te 3 p.m, ko tōna tikanga ka tukua atu mā runga i ngā tereina e tika ana. E whā ngā whārangi o te nūpepa, e rua tekau mā waru ngā tīwae, ko ngā nūpepa ka hokona ia rā e 2,100 puta noa i ngā rohe o Ōtākou ki te Raki me Waitaki. Ko te tari o te ‘Oamaru Mail’ kei waenga pū i te Tiriti o Tyne. He whare paparanga rua, he mea āta whakatū mārire hei kāinga mō te nūpepa. He pūkaha wai, he pūkahu kapuni hoki ngā mea e pana ana i ōna mīhini, he mea whāngai ki ngā wai o te kāporeihana. Ko aua mīhini he mīhini whāngai-rua Wharfdale pūrua, e rua ngā mīhini Platen, e toru ngā linotype, me tētahi atu mīhini tino hou, me tētahi mīhini tawhito, e kīa ana nāna i tā te putanga tuatahi o te ‘Melbourne Age’ me te putanga tuatahi o te ‘Otago Daily Times’.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko ngā rangatira o te Oamaru Mail he uri nō te whānau Jones taea noatia ngā tau 1970 i hokona mai ai e NZ News Ltd, he pekanga nā Brierley. I muri ka hokona e Wilson and Horton ā, ka hokona hoki tērā ki APN NZ Media. I te marama o Nōema 2011, ka huri te Oamaru Mail he nūpepa rima-ata-i-te-wiki. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 2013, ka hokona te Oamaru Mail e tētahi kamupena ā-whānau tūmataiti nō Ōtautahi arā, e Mainland Media Ltd. I hokona hoki e te kamupene te Christchurch Star, me ētahi atu nūpepa hapori e ono i te rohe whānui o Ōtautahi, ko APN tō mua rangatira. He kaipupuri hea ngātahi a Charlotte Smulders, me tana tāne, he mema nō te whānau Smith e noho nei hei rangatira mō te Allied Press me te Otago Daily Times. Ko te maha o ngā kaipānui o te Oamaru Mail e utu ana mō te nūpepa kei te 2,900 ngā kape. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The discovery of gold in Gabriel’s Gully in 1861 led to a huge increase in the population of Dunedin, going from fewer than 2,000 inhabitants to nearly 15,000 by the end of the 1860s. Julius Vogel (1835-1899) arrived in Dunedin in October 1861 and became editor of the weekly Otago Witness. Together with the Otago Witness publisher William Cutten, Vogel started up the Otago Daily Times. The first issue appeared on 15 November 1861, making it the first daily newspaper in New Zealand, and the one with the longest history of daily publication.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

One of the highlights of the paper’s history is the exposure of working conditions in Dunedin sweatshops in the 1880s by chief reporter Silas Spragg and editor George Fenwick. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nearly a century later the Otago Daily Times Ltd and the Evening Star Company Ltd merged in 1975, followed within a few years by the transformation of the Evening Star into a community newspaper.

It appeared twice a week, on Saturday and Wednesday mornings and was hand-set. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Founder Edwin Edwards arrived in Paeroa in the early 1880s and started off his newspaper career by founding the Gazette with J.H. Moore and H.C. Wick, then in 1896, the Te Aroha Times and Waiorongomai Advocate, with J.W. Parry. He was an amateur geologist who at one time owned part of the Waihi Mine, was active in local affairs and was a writer of ballads, which often appeared in the Ohinemuri Gazette. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ownership was taken over in 1900 by William Dennis Nicholas and Henry Howard Lyes (retired 1901). Nicholas changed the Gazette to an evening paper, appearing three times a week. Fire swept through the Wharf St office of the Gazette in 1908, but it continued to be published (printed by the owner of Waihi Times). New printing premises were opened in Princes St with an up-to-date press. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Hauraki Tribune was incorporated into the Ohinemuri Gazette in 1896, with a title change in 1921 to the Hauraki Plains Gazette. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Hauraki Plains Gazette was incorporated into the Thames Valley Gazette in 1977, with two other local newspapers, and then it became the Paeroa Gazette in 1988. This merged with the Thames Star in 1998 to become the Thames Valley Gazette, but the new publication lasted less than a year. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Otago Witness was a significant example of the illustrated weekly newspapers that were a popular and important form of publication in New Zealand in the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were particularly popular in isolated rural areas where poor access prevented newspapers being delivered daily. These papers were the main medium for published illustrations and photographs. Others examples include the Weekly News (Auckland) and the New Zealand Free Lance (Wellington).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Witness began in 1851 as a four page, fortnightly newspaper and started publishing weekly in August that year. The Witness took its title from the Edinburgh Witness, which was a popular journal in Scotland. In its early years the Witness took a high moral stance. However it was actually insulting, vindictive and highly biased in the way that it helped William Cargill (leader of the Otago Association, the branch of the New Zealand Company responsible for the initial settlement of Otago), fight his political opponents. Over time it settled down and became an inoffensive journal that was widely distributed, particularly in the South Island.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first the Otago Witness struggled to pay its way. In 1855 the paper had only 210 subscribers but by 1864 the paper was printing 4,500 copies a week. The newspaper's fortunes were secured in the 1860s by the influx of people into Otago looking for gold. The Witness also published an edition especially for the goldfields.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During this time the paper's popularity was further improved by introducing illustrations. Initially these were engravings but around 1900 the Witness started using photographs on an insert. The illustrated content increased considerably over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the Witness was probably the most conservative of the pictorial weeklies it provided an important outlet for New Zealand writers by regularly publishing poetry and short stories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like the other New Zealand weekly newspapers the Witness was adversely affected by the increasing development of rural land as well as competition from broadcasting. The paper stopped publication in 1932.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;He tino tauira te Otago Witness o ngā nūpepa ā-wiki whai whakaahua, he tūmomo whakaputanga nui, i paingia hoki i Aotearoa i te rau tau 1800-1899 me te tīmatanga o te rau tau 1900-1999. He mea tino pai i ngā wāhi taratahi nā te koretake o ngā rori i kore ai e taea te tuku ia rā. Ko ēnei nūpepa te mea nui mō te whakaputa pikitia, whakaahua hoki. Ko ētahi atu tauira ko te Weekly News (ākarana) me te New Zealand Free Lance (Pōneke).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ka tīmata te Witness i te tau 1851, e whā ōna whārangi, he nūpepa o ia rua wiki, ā, ka tīmata te whakaputa ia wiki i te marama o Here-turi-kōkā i taua tau. Nō te Edinburgh Witness tōna ingoa, he nūpepa i paingia i Kotirana. I ōna tau tīmatanga, he tūnga whanonga tika teitei rawa atu tōna. Heoi, he whakaiti, he mauāhara, he kino nō te rītaha ki te tautoko i a William Cargill (te kaihautū o te Otago Association, arā, te peka o te Kamupene o Niu Tīreni nāna te whakanohonoho tuatahi o te Pākehā i ōtākou) me tāna whakataetae ki ōna hoariri tōrangapū. Nāwai rā ka tau te puehu, ka huri hei nūpepa ngāwari i whakaputaina whānui, ki te Waipounamu rā anō.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tīmatanga he uaua te utu a te Otago Witness i āna nama.

Ka mau i te tekau tau mai i 1860 nā te urutanga mai o Hōpara i ngā pānuitangata ki ōtākou ki te kimi kōura.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Progress was New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s first architectural periodical. Published in Wellington from 1905 to 1924 and heavily illustrated with photos, drawings and plans, it is an essential resource for the study of architecture and building in New Zealand in the early twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was initially published by Wellington patent attorneys, Baldwin &amp;amp; Rayward under the title of Progress. Its first issue in 1905 promised to &amp;quot;treat of progress in engineering, processes, inventions, industrial work and economics as applied to any of these subjects.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1910 the magazine was taken over by Harry Tombs (1874-1966). Tombs, son of Whitcombe &amp;amp; Tombs founder George Tombs, was a well-known printer, patron of the arts and publisher of fine arts periodicals. Progress was the first of his magazines; the best known was probably Art in New Zealand (1928-44).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under Tombs, Progress focused on architecture and building; this was signalled by a change of title in 1914 to N.Z. Building Progress. This specialisation was identified by the publishers in the final issue (April 1924) as one of the reasons why they were suspending publication. It was intimated that publication would resume when &amp;quot;conditions become more favourable&amp;quot;. However Progress was not restarted. Instead, in 1926, Tombs published another architectural magazine, New Zealand Architectural and Building Review. This lasted until Tombs started Art in New Zealand two years later.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Ko Tombs (te tama o te kaiwhakaū o Whitcombe &amp;amp; Tombs, a George Tombs), tētahi kaiwhakatā rongonui, he kaitautoko o ngā mahi toi, he kaiwhakaputa hoki i ngā hautaka toi. Ko Progress te tuatahi o āna hautaka; ko te mea tino rongonui pea ko Art in New Zealand (1928-44).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I raro i a Tombs ko te hoahoanga me te hanganga whare te arotahi o Progress, otirā i tohua hoki tēnei mā te whakawhitinga o te ingoa ki NZ Building Progress i te tau 1914.

Mr Ivess is the gentleman&amp;rsquo;s name ....&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the Patea Mail was launched on 14 June 1875, the Taranaki Herald commented: &amp;lsquo;Newspapers, as a rule, are not the best speculations in which a person can invest his money; but, from the appearance of the Mail, we imagine that it will be a very profitable affair ....&amp;rsquo; &amp;nbsp;This would have been music to ears of the owner, Joseph Ivess,&amp;nbsp; who was always more interested in selling on than running for any length of time the many papers he started.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alexander Black ran the paper for the absent proprietor for a period, and briefly leased it, before Ivess appeared again, selling the Patea Mail to Edward Houghton in June 1880. With the sale came a change of name to Patea County Mail, the Taranaki Herald noting: &amp;lsquo;He [Houghton] has altered the style of its &amp;lsquo;make-up&amp;rsquo;, putting the advertisements at the bottom of the paper, which is a very attractive feature in it&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an unsuccessful experiment, the paper became the Patea Daily Mail for about four months from January 1882, the masthead then reverting to Patea Mail. James Clayton, previously manager of the Christchurch Daily Telegraph, bought the paper in September of that year. Another short-term owner, he then sold to Thomas Hamerton in June 1884. Hamerton re-launched the paper as the Patea County Press in October 1887, publishing on Mondays and Thursdays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thomas Hamerton sold to W C Cargill in late 1903. The paper William Cargill published and edited appeared three days a week &amp;ndash; on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays &amp;ndash; &amp;nbsp;and was, according to the 1908 Wellington provincial edition of The Cyclopedia of New Zealand, &amp;lsquo; ....a four-page sheet of seven columns per page. Each issue contains about twelve columns of reading matter, apart from advertisements&amp;rsquo;.&amp;nbsp; The&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Cyclopedia also noted: &amp;lsquo;The paper is independent in politics, and has a very extensive circulation, in the Patea and Waverley districts.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were several subsequent owners after Cargill, including Edward F Hemingway who bought the plant of the short-lived tri-weekly, the Waverley Tribune, in 1914. The Patea paper, subsequently known as the Patea and Waverley Press, was carried on by Hemingway until 1941, when it was another wartime victim. An attempt to revive the paper in 1946 was unsuccessful. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The owners of Napier's Hawke's Bay Herald, in partnership with others, set up the Poverty Bay Herald. The first issue of this bi-weekly morning paper was published in Gisborne on 5 January 1874. When the paper started publication Gisborne already had a newspaper, the Poverty Bay Standard (1872-1883).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like most New Zealand newspapers in the 19th century, it took the Herald some time to get established. In 1879 the paper nearly went into liquidation when the City of Glasgow Bank failed. However the Herald started to flourish in the 1880s. It proved too strong for its competitor, the Standard, which folded in 1883.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The outright acquisition of the paper in 1884 by Allan Ramsay Muir gave it stability. Muir's father had worked on the earliest New Zealand newspaper, the New Zealand Gazette as well as being one of the founders of the Wellington Independent (one of the country's most distinctive papers). Muir started working at the Herald in 1880 as a printer. He became a partner in 1883 and sole owner the year after. His descendants are still involved in the management of the paper today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were a number of other papers published in Gisborne before 1940. The most noteworthy is the Gisborne Times (1896-1938) but none of them were able to compete with the Herald. In 1938 the Herald absorbed the Times and the following year the paper changed its name to the Gisborne Herald.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper is still published and is one of the last privately operated daily newspapers in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;In 1864, Havelock, a small settlement at the head of Pelorus Sound in Marlborough, about 40 kms north-west of Blenheim, was close to the scene of a short, frantic gold rush. The township mushroomed in size as miners arrived from the Otago diggings to try their luck on the Wakamarina field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Nelson Examiner&amp;rsquo;s special Canvas Town correspondent wrote: &amp;lsquo;I paid a short visit to Havelock a few days since, and was very much struck by the almost incredible change which had taken place since I was there weeks ago; instead of a few buildings and a limited number even of tents, scattered here and there among the fern and tutu, I found a thriving town with a good open street of considerable length: many of the buildings are of wood or corrugated iron, while the number of canvas and calico tenements, ranged for the most part in lines, is quite astonishing.&amp;rsquo; The correspondent also noted: &amp;lsquo;Havelock boasts a newspaper, called the Havelock Mail.&amp;nbsp; I have seen the printing office, while the hands were at work. The plant and all the arrangements are, I think, very creditable. A newspaper will be a great convenience to the inhabitants, and will probably succeed as a speculation.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, the very short-lived bi-weekly Havelock Mail is best remembered as the first newspaper venture of Henry Blundell, his sons, and David Curie who the next year launched Wellington&amp;rsquo;s Evening Post. By early 1865, most of the miners and the proprietors of the Havelock Mail had moved on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite its name, the mining era was a fading memory when Havelock&amp;rsquo;s second paper, the bi-weekly Pelorus Guardian and Miner&amp;rsquo;s Advocate was launched on 24 January 1890 by G K Wakelin, youngest son of Greytown&amp;rsquo;s Richard Wakelin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper survived, against the odds, until 1920 when its last editorial on 26 March said: &amp;lsquo;It has been a long and weary struggle during the horrible world war. Although the aftermath proved too powerful for our weakened frame, we have done our best in the interests of the district and the colony.&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The paper was published to assist people in interpreting the scriptures, especially those without ready access to ministers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason for publishing this paper was given by Reverend Frederick Bennett as: &amp;lsquo;No te mea he nui nga tikanga o te whakapono kaore i te ata marama ki te nuinga o te tangata, &amp;#39;ko te kotinga hoki e nui ana, ko nga kai-mahi e ruarua ana, (Matiu 9.37)&amp;#39; (March, 1898: 2) [Because there are a great many religious practices that are not readily understood by the majority of the people, &amp;#39;the harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few&amp;#39; (Matthew 9.37)].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Koia tenei te tukuna atu nei te Kupu Whakamarama, ki nga marae o o koutou takiwa takoto ai, hei titiro ma koutou, hei whakaaro ma koutou, hei awhina i a koutou i runga i nga tikanga e rapua nei e te ngakau, kia marama ai ta tatou hikoi i runga i te huarahi whaiti o to tatou whakapono (ibid. ). [Te Kupu Whakamarama is being sent to all marae and districts, for you to read and ponder over; to help you come to a clear understanding of the Faith, so that we may willingly tread its (straight and) narrow path].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last issue published under the title He Kupu Whakamarama was December 1898; the newspaper then became Te Pipiwharauroa (1899-1913).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People were asked to provide a new name for the paper and suggestions flooded in from throughout New Zealand. The name sent in by Nikora Tautau of Te Pourewa, Waikato, Te Pipiwharauroa (Shining Cuckoo) was chosen (January, 1899: 4). He Kupu Whakamarama was retained for the first few issues to show the link with that paper (ibid. : 1). The format was the same but there were more items on worldly rather than religious issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From December 1899 a subscription of 5 shillings per year was charged. Nos. 16 - 17 (June and July 1899) contain a 2 page supplement printed in Gisborne by H W Williams at the Te Rau Press. From No. 18 (August 1899) onward the paper moved to Gisborne, and the full issue was printed by H W Williams at the Te Rau Press.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reverend Frederick Bennett continued as the editor. Nos. 16 and 17 were edited jointly by Reverend F A Bennett and Reverend Reweti Tūhorouta Kōhere (Ngāti Porou), the son of the chief Mokena Kōhere and nephew of Te Kakatarau who signed the Treaty of Waitangi at Waiapu. From No. 18 onward the newspaper was edited solely by Kōhere. Under his editorship the subjects covered broader scope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper (usually referred to as Te Pipi), ran for some fourteen years and then, due to problems associated with the cost of printing and distribution, Te Pipiwharauroa ceased (Te Pipiwharauroa, July 1913: 1).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another smaller newspaper Te Kopara was organised by the Church of England (Te Kopara October, 1913: 1).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This paper is written in Māori.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For further information, &amp;nbsp;see May the People Live by Raeburn Lange (Auckland: Auckland University Press, 1999), Rere atu, taku manu! edited by J Curnow, N Hopa and J McRae (Auckland: Auckland University Press, 2002), and Books in Māori by P Parkinson and P Griffith (Auckland: Reed, 2004), S41 and S42, pp.813-816.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Library would like to thank Gail Dallimore for providing information used in essays about Maori newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The new tabloid was just four pages long and came out once a week. As demand grew it increased in size and frequency, becoming bi-weekly from 1 October 1912 and tri-weekly from 5 July 1915. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Franklin Printing &amp; Publishing Company acquired the Pukekohe &amp; Waiuku Times in November 1914. The new owners changed the title to the Franklin &amp; Pukekohe Times on 2 September 1919, then to the Franklin Times on 1 February 1921.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite the changes of title, the volume numbering remained consistent throughout. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The changes of title in part reflected broadening coverage. The original masthead shows the paper aimed to include Pukekohe, Waiuku, Mercer, Tuakau, Drury, Papakura and Bombay news. It then sought to reach into all parts of Franklin County. For some years it included a Papakura section on the back page, and sometimes also included Otahuhu and Manurewa news. In later years coverage reached southward across the Waikato River to include news from the northern parts of Raglan County. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A short-lived companion title, the Pukekohe &amp; Otahuhu Times came out between 13 April 1917 and 28 December 1917. A later companion title, the Tuakau and District Times, lasted from 10 March 1932 to 14 September 1939. In November 1964 the Franklin Times absorbed its almost equally long-lived small-town rival, the Waiuku News. (The 1965 masthead read: 'The Franklin Times, incorporating the Waiuku News. Circulating in the whole of Franklin County and parts of Raglan and Manukau Counties').&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The last issue of the Franklin Times came out on 19 January 1971. It was then merged with the South Auckland News Advertiser to form the Franklin Times Advertiser. However, after a subsequent merger with the South Auckland Courier, the Franklin Times was revived as a stand-alone title between April 1974 and July 1979. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I muri mai, i whai te pepa kia whātoro ia ki ngā wāhi katoa o Franklin County. Mō ētahi tau i uru mai tētahi wāhanga kōrero mō Papakura i te whārangi o muri, ā, i ētahi wā anō i uru hoki ko ngā rongo o Otahuhu me Manurewa.

Circulating in the whole of Franklin County and parts of Raglan and Manukau Counties’).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I puta mai te putanga whakamutunga o te Franklin Times i te 19 Hānuere 1971. Kātahi ka whakahanumitia ki roto i te South Auckland News Advertiser kia tū mai te Franklin Times Advertiser. Ahakoa rā, i muri i tētahi whakahanumitanga ki te South Auckland Courier, i whakaorangia mai te Franklin Times hei taitara tū motuhake i waenga i te marama o Āperira 1974 me te marama o Hūrae 1979. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Australian Charles de La Roche began the newspaper in 1901. After his first foray into newspaper ownership with the short-lived Tauranga Herald in 1899, he moved to Warkworth and quickly established a successful real estate business. He also bought a poorly performing paper, the Gazette, ostensibly serving the Waitemata and Kaipara areas, and used its press to launch Warkworth’s first newspaper. The masthead read Rodney and Otamatea Times, but the secondary heading, Waitemata and Kaipara Gazette, suggested de La Roche had hopes of retaining some readership there. It did not help his cause that the first issue made no mention of either area. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The weekly Rodney and Otamatea Times, a four-page broadsheet, was printed on a Furnival flat-bed press. Two casual workers shared the job of turning the large wheel by hand while the printer fed sheets of newsprint to the rollers. The newspaper, published on Fridays, sold for 3d a copy, and the annual subscription was eight shillings. The Times soon acquired a reputation for its reporting and comment on local politics, but sporting enthusiasts found coverage disappointing. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After de La Roche sold the newspaper to A H Mason late in 1903, his real estate and property activities thrived. He later edited the Manukau Gazette in Onehunga where he retired, dying in 1938. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Times had a number of other owners before Wairarapa printer William Cook bought the paper in 1917, the beginning of a three generation publishing dynasty that was to last 88 years. William Cook was editor until his death in 1942. His son Elsley, a former banker and World War One veteran, succeeded him in the editor’s chair and in running the company. Following his unexpected death in 1955, aged 62, his wife Marjorie headed the company until 1976, buying two opposition papers and withstanding a takeover bid from Wilson and Horton. Their son, Tony Cook, took over as managing director and, converting to web-offset, significantly developed the company’s commercial printing activities. The Times shifted from a paid subscription to free distribution model. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 2005 the Cook family sold the twice-weekly Rodney Times to Fairfax New Zealand.&lt;p&gt;</Essay>

I muri i tāna hounga tuatahi ki ngā mahi pupuri niupepa, arā i te Tauranga Herald i ora mō te wā poto noa iho i te tau 1899, ka nuku ia ki Warkworth, ā, he tere tonu tana whakatū umanga hoko whenua, hoko kāinga whai painga. Ka hokona e ia tētahi niupepa āhua korekaha, e kīia nei te Gazette, tōna tikanga hei niupepa mō ngā rohe o Waitemata me Kaipara, ā, ka whakamahia e ia tāna mīhini tā hei whakarewa i te niupepa tuatahi o Warkworth. Ko te taitara ko te Rodney and Otamatea Times, engari ko te taitara o raro ko te Waitemata and Kaipara Gazette, e whakaaro ai pea te tangata i te wawata a de La Roche kia kitea he kaipānui i taua takiwā. Hei whakararu pea i tāna mahi, kāore he kupu kotahi i te putanga tuatahi mō tētahi o aua rohe e rua.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He rau whānui, he whā whārangi hoki te niupepa ā-wiki Rodney and Otamatea Times, i tāia ki tētahi mīhini pāraharaha Furnival.

Puta ai te niupepa ia Paraire, ko te utu he 3d (toru kapa) mō te kape kotahi, ko te utu ā-tau e waru herengi. Ka piki te ingoa o te Times mō ana mahi kawe kōrero me āna whakaputanga kupu mō ngā take o te rohe, engari kāore i tino nui ngā kōrero mō ngā mahi hākinakina mā te hunga ngākaunui ki ēnā mahi.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I muri i te hokonga a de La Roche i te niupepa ki A H Mason i ngā marama whakamutunga o 1903, ka tupu tuawhiti tonu āna mahi hoko whenua, hoko rawa. Nō muri ka noho ia hei ētita mō te Manukau Gazette i Onehunga i tuku ai ia i tana tūranga, ka mate rawa i te tau 1938.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Arā atu anō ngā rangatira o te Times i mua i te hokonga o te pepa e tētahi kaitā nō Wairarapa e William Cook i te tau 1917, i tīmata ai tētahi umanga tā niupepa tuku iho i toitū tonu mō te 88 tau. I noho tonu ko William Cook te ētita taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1942. Ka piki tana tama a Elsley, he kaimahi pēke i mua, he toa tū taua i te Pakanga Tuatahi o Te Ao, ki tōna tūru ētita, kaiwhakahaere hoki i te kamupene. Nō muri i tana matenga ohorere i te tau 1955, e 62 ōna tau, ka eke tāna wahine a Marjorie ki te tūnga kaiwhakahaere i te kamupene tae noa ki 1976. I huri ia ki te hoko i ētahi pepa tauwhāinga e rua, ā, i tū pakari hoki ia ki te ārai i tētahi kōkiri hoko i te umanga nā Wilson and Horton. I riro nā tā rāua tama, Tony Cook, i whakahaere te kamupene hei kaihautū whakahaere, ā, ka hurihia e ia ki te tikanga web-offset, nā ana mahi i tino whanake nui ai ngā mahi tā arumoni o te kamupene. I huri te Times mai i te tētahi niupepa utu ā-tau ki tētahi niupepa tuari utu-kore.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te tau 2005 ka hokona e te whānau Cook te niupepa rua-wiki o te Rodney Times ki Fairfax New Zealand. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

The first half of the paper was published in German and the second half in English. Emil Lubke edited the German text while F Muller, from Queensland, edited the English section. When Muller left in January 1910 his place was taken by James Ah Sue of Chinese-Samoan heritage. With the New Zealand occupation of Samoa on 29 August 1914 changes to the ownership and content were bound to follow. James Ah Sue effectively took over the editorship of the paper and the newspaper’s name changed to The Samoa Times as from January 1915. The paper became an English language newspaper with a German language supplement, which continued into 1916. In July 1916 the paper was bought by James Ah Sue who edited the paper until his death on 21 November 1918 from influenza. The Samoa Times continued until 28 February 1930.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The first newspaper in Samoa was published by the London Missionary Society, a biannual publication called the Samoan Reporter, which appeared during the 1840s to the 1860s reporting missionary news and well as some general items.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first attempt at a commercial newspaper was the Samoa Times [and South Sea Gazette] which was owned by George Lyttleton Griffiths, who also was owner of the Fiji Times which began publishing in 1869 in Levuka, Fiji. The first issue of the Samoa Times was published on 6 October 1877, its editor being William Edgar Agar, who remained editor until 1880, when he resigned for health reasons. His place was taken by Andrew Speirs until the newspaper folded in 1881. The final issue of the paper was published on 27 August 1881.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was seven years before another attempt at a newspaper for Samoa was made. This was the Samoa Times and South Sea Advertiser, owned and edited by Stephen J Cusack of Apia. The first issue was published on 29 September 1888 and continued, with changes in ownership and editors, until the final issue on 26 December 1896.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some competition for readers arrived when the Samoa Weekly Herald appeared on 26 November 1892. It was owned and initially edited by James Rattray MacFarland, a New Zealander. However MacFarland was bankrupt within six months and the newspaper was bought by a German trader E A Grevsmuhl, but within a short time it was sold to H Denvers. At the end of 1896 Denvers bought out the competition, the Samoa Times, but was forced to sell the paper in 1898 to W A King to pay for his debts. The last issue published of the Samoa Weekly Herald was on 28 August 1900. The newspaper was sold to German financial interests in 1901 when it was revived and renamed as Samoanische Zeitung, a change which reflected the new German administration of Samoa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Samoanische Zeitung&amp;rsquo;s first issue was on 6 April 1901. The first half of the paper was published in German and the second half in English. Emil Lubke edited the German text while F Muller, from Queensland, edited the English section.

In July 1916 the paper was bought by James Ah Sue who edited the paper until his death on 21 November 1918 from influenza.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Samoa Times continued until 28 February 1930. It was replaced by the Samoa Herald, which ran until 27 March 1936 and was continued by the Western Samoa Mail, which ceased publication on 28 March 1942 due to the war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Information for this short introduction has been largely referenced from two publications written by Dirk H R Spennemann, &lt;a href="http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1710330"&gt; &amp;lsquo;The heritage of nineteenth century Samoan newspapers : a bibliographical documentation&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1710335"&gt; &amp;lsquo;Gedruckt in Samoa : a bibliographical analysis of German colonial printing (1901-1914)&amp;rsquo; &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O le nusipepa muamua lava i Samoa sa saunia ma lolomiina e le London Missionary Society, ma sa lolomiina ta&amp;#39;ilua tausaga, sa faaigoaina o le Samoan Reporter, lea sa i ai mai le 1840 i le 1860 sa lipotiina ai tala i galuega faamisionare faapea ai foi ma nisi tala ma mataupu faalaua&amp;#39;itele.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O le taumafaiga muamua lava i se nusipepa o faasalalauga faapisinisi o le nusipepa Samoa Times [and South Sea Gazette] lea sa faia e George Lyttleton Griffiths, o lana lava pepa, o ia foi lenei e ona le nusipepa Fiti o le Fiji Times lea sa amata ona lolomiina i le 1869 i Levuka, i Fiti.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Southland Times has been published in Invercargill since 1862. Since 1968 it has been Invercargill’s only daily newspaper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Times was set up by Gerard George Fitzgerald, John T. Downes and Charles Reynolds and published its first issue on 12 November 1862 under the title of the Invercargill Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Times was established to oppose the Southern News (later the Southland Daily News), another Invercargill newspaper. The Southern News had begun publication the year before and was regarded as a liberal paper. The Times represented more conservative opinions. 1862 also was a good time to start a newspaper in Invercargill because the town was prospering due to the discovery of gold in the Wakatipu that year. Invercargill was the main supply base for the goldfield.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The history of the paper in the 1860s and 70s is similar to that of other newspapers in New Zealand at the time. The paper experienced financial difficulties, frequent changes of owner and the loss of plant and offices due to fire. The Times ceased publication for several months in 1864 after a fire destroyed its office. When it resumed publication in June that year it was under the new title of the Southland Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1875 the Times became a daily. In 1878 fire destroyed the newspaper office again. As in 1864, the Times’ rival, the Southland News, helped the paper continue to publish by allowing the Times to use their presses. During this period the Times published a weekly edition for its rural readers; the Weekly Times ran from 1866 to 1933.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 1880s the Times achieved stability and prosperity. This was due in large part to the very capable management provided by the paper’s owner, Robert Gilmour. Gilmour, who had assumed control of the paper in 1879, had been involved with the press in Invercargill since 1864. He had briefly owned the Times in 1869, before taking over the Southland News. In the mid-1870s he had moved back to Scotland for several years. Upon returning to Invercargill in 1879 he acquired the Times for a second time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gilmour family owned and managed the paper until 1984, when it was sold to Independent Newspapers Limited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the features of the Times and one of the main reasons that it has endured is that it stayed abreast of developments in newspaper technology. In the 1900s it upgraded its plant twice with the introduction of linotypes and then rotary presses. It was the first newspaper in New Zealand outside of the main centres to employ rotary presses. In the 1970s and 80s the Times was one of the first papers in New Zealand to use computer-driven newspaper technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Times approach to technological change is probably one of the main reasons that it eventually overtook its old rival the Southland Daily News. The Times acquired the News in 1967 and in 1968 replaced it with an evening edition of its own. The Times evening edition ceased in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Kua tāngia te Southland Times ki Waihopai (Invercargill) mai i te tau 1862. Koia anake tō Waihopai nūpepa ā-rangi mai i te tau 1968.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nā Gerard George Fitzgerald rātou ko John T. Downes, ko Charles Reynolds te Times i whakaū, ā, i whakatā tōna tānga tuatahi i te 12 o Whiringa-ā-rangi 1862 i raro i te ingoa o te Invercargill Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I whakaū ai te Times hei tautohe ki te Southern News (nō muri mai ko te Southland Daily News), arā, tētahi atu nūpepa i Waihopai. Kua tīmata hoki te tānga o te Southern News i te tau i mua atu, ā, i tirohia hoki hei nūpepa whakaaro whānui. I tū te Times hei māngai mō ngā whakaaro tūpato. He wā pai tonu te tau 1862 hei tīmata i tētahi nūpepa i Waihopai, nōtemea i te tōnui haere te tāone i te kitenga o te kōura i Wakatipu i taua tau anō. Ko Waihopai te pokapū matua o ngā putunga mō te pārae kōura. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He rite tonu te hītori o te nūpepa, i roto i te huinga tau mai i 1860 ki te 1880, ki tō ētahi atu nūpepa o Aotearoa i taua wā. I mōhio te nūpepa ki ngā raruraru moni, ki ngā whakawhitinga rangatira, ki te ngaromanga o te taonga, o te tari hoki ki te ahi. I whakamutua te tānga o te Times ētahi marama maha i te tau 1864 i muri i te ngaromanga o tōna tari ki tētahi ahi. Nō ka tīmata anō tōna tānga i te marama o Pipiri o taua tau, i raro kē ia i te ingoa o te Southland Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1875 ka meinga hei nūpepa ā-rangi te Times. I te tau 1878 ka kāia anō te tari o te nūpepa e te ahi. Pērā anō i taka i te tau 1864, nā te tāwhai o te Times, arā, nā te Southland News a ia i āwhina kia haere tonu tana tānga mā te tukunga kia whakamahia e te Times ō rātou perehi. I taua wā hoki, i tāngia e te Times tētahi tānga ā-wiki mā ōna kaipānui o te taiwhenua; rere ana te Weekly Times mai i te tau 1866 ki 1933.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tekau tau mai i 1880 i tino ū ai te Times i whiwhi hoki i te tōnuitanga. He huanga matua tēnei nā te whakahaere tino pai tonu a Ropata Gilmour, te tangata nāna nei te nūpepa. I whai wāhi hoki a Gilmour, nāna rā i tango i te whakahaerenga o te Times i te tau 1879, ki te mahi tā nūpepa i Waihopai mai te tau 1864. Nāna hoki te Times mō tētahi wā poto i te tau 1869, i mua i tana taumanu i te Southland News. Tae rawa a waenganui tonu o te tekau tau mai i 1870, kua hoki anō a ia ki Koterana mō ētahi tau. Nō tana hokinga ki Waihopai i te tau 1879 ka hoko tuarua mai ai ia i te Times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nā te whānau Gilmour te nūpepa, nā rātou hoki i whakahaere tae noa te tau 1984, nā ka hokona atu ki te kamupene Independent Newspapers Limited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko tētahi āhuatanga o te Times, he take matua hoki tēnei i matatū ai ia, ko tana haere upane tahi ai me ngā whanaketanga o te hangarau tānga nūpepa. I ngā tau mai i 1900 e rua āna whakahoutanga i ōna mīhini, arā, mā te whakamahi i te perehi tā ā-rārangi (Linotype) i te tuatahi, i kō atu o te perehi hurihuri. Koia tonu te nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa, i waho tonu o ngā tāone matua, ki te whakamahi i te perehi hurihuri. I te rua tekau tau mai i 1970 ki te 1990, ko te Times tētahi o ngā nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa ki te whakamahi i te hangarau tānga nā te rorohiko i pana. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko tō te Times āro ki ngā whitinga hangarau tētahi take matua pea i mahue rawa i a ia tōna tāwhai tawhito, a te Southland Daily News. I riro te News i a te Times i te tau 1967, ā, i te tau 1968 i whakakapia te News i tētahi tānga ahiahi ōna ake. I whakamutua te tānga ahiahi o te Times i te tau 1976. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

It was owned and initially edited by James Rattray MacFarland, a New Zealander. However MacFarland was bankrupt within six months and the newspaper was bought by a German trader E A Grevsmuhl, but within a short time it was sold to H Denvers. At the end of 1896 Denvers bought out the competition, the Samoa Times, but was forced to sell the paper in 1898 to W A King to pay for his debts. The last issue published of the Samoa Weekly Herald was on 28 August 1900. The newspaper was sold to German financial interests in 1901 when it was revived and renamed as Samoanische Zeitung, a change which reflected the new German administration of Samoa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Samoanische Zeitung&amp;rsquo;s first issue was on 6 April 1901. The first half of the paper was published in German and the second half in English. Emil Lubke edited the German text while F Muller, from Queensland, edited the English section. When Muller left in January 1910 his place was taken by James Ah Sue of Chinese-Samoan heritage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the New Zealand occupation of Samoa on 29 August 1914 changes to the ownership and content were bound to follow.

The paper became an English language newspaper with a German language supplement, which continued into 1916. In July 1916 the paper was bought by James Ah Sue who edited the paper until his death on 21 November 1918 from influenza.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Samoa Times continued until 28 February 1930.

In July 1916 the paper was bought by James Ah Sue who edited the paper until his death on 21 November 1918 from influenza.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Samoa Times continued until 28 February 1930. It was replaced by the Samoa Herald, which ran until 27 March 1936 and was continued by the Western Samoa Mail, which ceased publication on 28 March 1942 due to the war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Information for this short introduction has been largely referenced from two publications written by Dirk H R Spennemann,&lt;a href="http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1710330"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1710330"&gt; &amp;lsquo;The heritage of nineteenth century Samoan newspapers : a bibliographical documentation&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1710330"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1710335"&gt; &amp;lsquo;Gedruckt in Samoa : a bibliographical analysis of German colonial printing (1901-1914)&amp;rsquo; &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O le nusipepa muamua lava i Samoa sa saunia ma lolomiina e le London Missionary Society, ma sa lolomiina ta&amp;#39;ilua tausaga, sa faaigoaina o le Samoan Reporter, lea sa i ai mai le 1840 i le 1860 sa lipotiina ai tala i galuega faamisionare faapea ai foi ma nisi tala ma mataupu faalaua&amp;#39;itele.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O le taumafaiga muamua lava i se nusipepa o faasalalauga faapisinisi o le nusipepa Samoa Times [and South Sea Gazette] lea sa faia e George Lyttleton Griffiths, o lana lava pepa, o ia foi lenei e ona le nusipepa Fiti o le Fiji Times lea sa amata ona lolomiina i le 1869 i Levuka, i Fiti.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; In 1912, Edward C Huie resigned from editorship of the Press Company’s Evening News in Christchurch, frustrated that the proprietors were not interested in the young Australian’s ideas about livelier journalism and layout. The Evening News’ primary role was to carry news and advertisements too late for that day’s Press. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The 36-year-old Huie announced shortly afterwards his intention to launch a third evening paper, a competitor to the Evening News and the Lyttelton Times’ Star. In October 1912 the NZPA reported that the Canterbury Publishing Company had been registered with a capital of £75,000 (about $11.75 million today). The report noted that Huie would be editor and the paper’s backers were ‘prominent supporters of the Reform [precursor to National] party’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Sun, modelled on London’s Daily Mail, without the British popular press’s sensationalism, was launched in February 1914. It was an immediate success with Christchurch readers and advertisers. Its reporting was energetic and there was much more illustration than common in New Zealand dailies of the time. It also gave considerable encouragement to poets, short story writers and essayists. The Evening News closed in 1917 and the Sun was soon outstripping the Star in circulation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Buoyed by this success, Huie convinced his directors to enter the lucrative Auckland newspaper market. A new company, Sun Newspapers Ltd, acquired the property of the Canterbury Publishing Company, and in March 1927 Auckland’s Sun was launched. Its journalistic approach appealed as much to Aucklanders as it had to Christchurch newspaper readers but the establishment costs in a much larger market and the deepening Depression were complicating factors. In 1929, the Brett Company, publishers of the Auckland Star, took over the Lyttelton Times Company. The merged company, New Zealand Newspapers Ltd, now owned Huie’s Auckland and Christchurch evening competitors. The ensuing pressure was too much and the Auckland Sun’s short, colourful life ended late in 1930 when New Zealand Newspapers bought the paper for about £62,000 ($6 million today.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The pressure intensified on Huie and the Sun in Christchurch, with the three newspaper companies discussing and rejecting a range of mergers and takeovers predicated on tacit agreement that four dailies were not sustainable, and one morning and one evening paper was desirable. In November 1934, both the Sun and Star halved their per copy price to one penny, with the Press following suit and picking up circulation that further weakened its evening competitors. With its losses mounting, the Sun directors – despite Huie’s desire to fight on – agreed to sell to New Zealand Newspapers in late May 1935. In early July the first issue of the Christchurch Star-Sun appeared. The evening daily retained this name until 1958 and was the Christchurch Star when it closed in 1991. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; From 1936 to 1939, Edward Huie was London representative of The Press. In 1940, he purchased, on behalf of a private company, the Hawke’s Bay Daily Mail, then in receivership. He managed and edited the newspaper until daily publication ended in June 1941. He died in Sydney in 1967. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; I te tau 1912, i tukua e Edward C Huie tāna tūranga etita mō te nūpepa o te Evening News a te Press Company o Ōtautahi, i runga i tana manawapā kāore ngā rangatira o te nūpepa i aronui ki ngā whakaaro o tēnei taitama nō Āhitereiria. Ko tana hiahia kia whakahoutia te nūpepa hei whakapiki i te pai me te hāngai o ngā pūrongo me te āhua o te nūpepa. Ko te mahi matua ia o te Evening News he kawe i ngā pitopito kōrero me ngā pānui kua tūreiti mō te Press o taua rā. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nā te tangata nei nā Huie, 36 ōna tau, i whakapuaki tana hiahia ki te kōkiri i tētahi nūpepa ā-ahiahi tuatoru, hei hoa tauwhāinga mō te Evening News me te Star a te Lyttelton Times. Nō te marama o Oketopa 1912 ka whakapuaki te NZPA kua rēhitatia te Canterbury Publishing Company me ōna moni punga £75,000 (tata ki te $11.75 miriona i ēnei rā). E ai ki te pūrongo ka noho ko Huie hei etita, ā, ko ngā tino kaihautū o te nūpepa' ‘he kaitautoko hira nō te rōpū tōrangapū Reform [te matua tēnei o te rōpū Nāhinara]’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I whakarewaina te Sun i te marama o Pēpuere 1914. He mea whakatauira mai ki runga i te Daily Mail o Rānana, engari kāore i pērā rawa tana wairua whakapātaritari. I tino rawe te nūpepa ki ngā kaipānui me ngā kaiwhakatairanga o Ōtautahi. He hihiri ana mahi kawe kōrero, ā, he nui noa atu ana pikitia i ō te nuinga o ngā nūpepa ā-rā o Aotearoa o aua wā. He kaha hoki te nūpepa ki te poipoi i ngā kaitito ruriruri, i ngā kaituhi pūrākau poto me ngā kaituhi tuhinga kaupapa. I kati te Evening News i te tau 1917 ā, kāore i roa i muri mai kei mua noa atu te nūpepa te Sun i te nūpepa o te Star mō te maha o ngā kaipānui. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I runga i ēnei hua tino pai, ka akiaki a Huie i ōna hoa kaihautū kia kuhu ki te mākete nūpepa moni nui o Tāmaki-makau-rau. Nā tētahi kamupene hou nā Sun Newspapers Ltd, i hoko ngā rawa o te Canterbury Publishing Company, ā, i te marama o Māehe 1927 ka whakarewaina te Sun o Tāmaki-makau-rau. Ko āna tikanga kawe kōrero i tino pai ki ngā kaipānui o Tāmaki-makau-rau, rite tonu ki ngā kaipānui i Ōtautahi, engari he mea uaua ngā utunga mō te whakatū i a ia i taua mākete nui kē atu, waihoki ngā taimahatanga o te Tūpuhi Nui o te Ao, i te mātotoru haere ōna whakawhiu i taua wā. I te tau 1929, nā te Brett Company, te kaiwhakaputa o te Auckland Star, i piki mai hei rangatira mō te Lyttelton Times Company. Ka noho ko te kamupene hanumi, New Zealand Newspapers , Ltd, hei rangatira mō ngā hoa tauwhāinga i Tāmaki me Ōtautahi ki ngā nūpepa ā-ahiahi o Huie. He kaha rawa te tāmitanga a aua hoa tauwhāinga, ā, ka mutu te oranga ngahau, te oranga poto o te Auckland Sun i ngā marama whakamutunga o 1930 i te hokonga a New Zealand Newspapers i te nūpepa mō te takiwā o te £62,000 ($6 miriona i ngā moni o nāianei.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ka piki rā te tāmitanga ki a Huie me te Sun i Ōtautahi, me te noho o ngā kamupene nūpepa e toru ki te whakawhiti kōrero me te whakakāhore i te huhua o ngā whakahanumitanga me ngā kōkiri hoko i runga i te kirimana ahuwhānui kāore e taea te whā nūpepa i te tāone kotahi, ā, kia hoki ki te nūpepa ā-ata kotahi me te nūpepa ā-ahiahi kotahi. Nō te marama o Nōema i te tau 1934, i hāwhengia e te Sun me te Star te utu o tā rātou utu mō te kape ki te kapa kotahi, me te whai mai a te Press i tērā huarahi, i piki ake ai ana tauanga hoko, me tana whakahoki tupu i ana hoa tauwhāinga o te ahiahi. Ka piki ngā rarunga, ka piki, ā, ka tau ngā whakaaro o ngā kaihautū o te Sun – ahakoa te hiahia o Huie kia whawhai tonu, kia hokona te pepa ki New Zealand Newspapers i ngā rā whakamutunga o Mei i te tau 1935. I ngā wiki tuatahi o Hūrae ka puta te putanga tuatahi o Christchurch Star-Sun. Ka mau tonu tēnei ingoa mō te nūpepa ā-rā taea noatia te tau 1958 ā, kua huri te ingoa hei Christchurch Star i te wā i kati ai i te tau 1991. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Mai i 1936 ki te tau 1939, i mahi a Edward Huie hei kanohi i Rānana ki Ingarangi mō The Press. I te tau 1940, i hokona e ia te Daily Mail o te Matau ā-Māui, mō tētahi kamupene tūmataiti. Ka whakahaere, ka ētita hoki ia i taua nūpepa tae rā anō ki mutunga o te pukapuka ā-rā i te marama o Hune 1941. I mate mai ia i Poihākena i te tau 1967.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The first newspaper in Samoa was published by the London Missionary Society, a biannual publication called the Samoan Reporter, which appeared during the 1840s to the 1860s reporting missionary news and well as some general items.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first attempt at a commercial newspaper was the Samoa Times [and South Sea Gazette] which was owned by George Lyttleton Griffiths, who also was owner of the Fiji Times which began publishing in 1869 in Levuka, Fiji. The first issue of the Samoa Times was published on 6 October 1877, its editor being William Edgar Agar, who remained editor until 1880, when he resigned for health reasons. His place was taken by Andrew Speirs until the newspaper folded in 1881. The final issue of the paper was published on 27 August 1881.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was seven years before another attempt at a newspaper for Samoa was made. This was the Samoa Times and South Sea Advertiser, owned and edited by Stephen J Cusack of Apia. The first issue was published on 29 September 1888 and continued, with changes in ownership and editors, until the final issue on 26 December 1896.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some competition for readers arrived when the Samoa Weekly Herald appeared on 26 November 1892. It was owned and initially edited by James Rattray MacFarland, a New Zealander. However MacFarland was bankrupt within six months and the newspaper was bought by a German trader E A Grevsmuhl, but within a short time it was sold to H Denvers. At the end of 1896 Denvers bought out the competition, the Samoa Times, but was forced to sell the paper in 1898 to W A King to pay for his debts. The last issue published of the Samoa Weekly Herald was on 28 August 1900. The newspaper was sold to German financial interests in 1901 when it was revived and renamed as Samoanische Zeitung, a change which reflected the new German administration of Samoa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Samoanische Zeitung&amp;rsquo;s first issue was on 6 April 1901. The first half of the paper was published in German and the second half in English. Emil Lubke edited the German text while F Muller, from Queensland, edited the English section. When Muller left in January 1910 his place was taken by James Ah Sue of Chinese-Samoan heritage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the New Zealand occupation of Samoa on 29 August 1914 changes to the ownership and content were bound to follow. James Ah Sue effectively took over the editorship of the paper and the newspaper&amp;rsquo;s name changed to The Samoa Times as from January 1915. The paper became an English language newspaper with a German language supplement, which continued into 1916. In July 1916 the paper was bought by James Ah Sue who edited the paper until his death on 21 November 1918 from influenza.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Samoa Times continued until 28 February 1930. It was replaced by the Samoa Herald, which ran until 27 March 1936 and was continued by the Western Samoa Mail, which ceased publication on 28 March 1942 due to the war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Information for this short introduction has been largely referenced from two publications written by Dirk H R Spennemann, &lt;a href="http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1710330"&gt; &amp;lsquo;The heritage of nineteenth century Samoan newspapers : a bibliographical documentation&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1710335"&gt; &amp;lsquo;Gedruckt in Samoa : a bibliographical analysis of German colonial printing (1901-1914)&amp;rsquo; &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O le nusipepa muamua lava i Samoa sa saunia ma lolomiina e le London Missionary Society, ma sa lolomiina ta&amp;#39;ilua tausaga, sa faaigoaina o le Samoan Reporter, lea sa i ai mai le 1840 i le 1860 sa lipotiina ai tala i galuega faamisionare faapea ai foi ma nisi tala ma mataupu faalaua&amp;#39;itele.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O le taumafaiga muamua lava i se nusipepa o faasalalauga faapisinisi o le nusipepa Samoa Times [and South Sea Gazette] lea sa faia e George Lyttleton Griffiths, o lana lava pepa, o ia foi lenei e ona le nusipepa Fiti o le Fiji Times lea sa amata ona lolomiina i le 1869 i Levuka, i Fiti.

The earliest issues did not name the editor. From 1954 it was Erik Schwimmer, from 1960 to 1961 he was temporarily replaced by Bruce Mason, and from 1962 to 1966 the editor was Margaret Orbell, who considerably increased the literary content, including the transcription of traditional work (such as a major series by Mervyn McLean and reprints from John White). She was replaced by Joy Stephenson, who continued to publish much fiction and poetry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Articles ranged from agriculture through recipes to wood carving and other crafts, as well as biographically important obituaries. There were also literary contributions, such as the bilingual presentation of legends (&amp;#39;How Ngarara-Huarau Was Killed&amp;#39; by Te Whetu, translated by T.G. Poutawera), and poems (a series of &amp;#39;Nga Titotito a Te Māori&amp;#39;, translated by Reweti Kohere).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Distinguished contributors included S.M.

Sturm, Kingi Ihaka, Maharaia Winiata, Turoa Royal, Leo Fowler, Hone Tuwhare, Barry Mitcalfe, Rowley Habib (Rore Hapipi), Patricia Grace and Riki Erehi, while works by older poets and storytellers (Mohi Turei) were revived. There were also annual literary competitions in Māori and in English.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As early as September 1959, the editor commented on &amp;#39;a quite recent development, the emergence of Maori writers attempting the novel, the short story and modern verse forms &amp;hellip;.. Altogether there must have been some dozens of Maoris who have recently started to write short stories, some with definite success&amp;#39;. In the following year, in judging a competition (won by Pita Sharples), he was even bolder: &amp;#39;The Maori writer seems instinctively to understand that the English language is one of unrivalled majesty and richness, not, as many pakehas demonstrate, a convenient method of shorthand. I expect - I say this in full confidence - that the next ten years will produce a Maori novelist of outstanding talent; already the ground is being prepared for him&amp;#39;. Nine years later Witi Ihimaera published his first book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NW [Nelson Wattie]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Extract from: The Oxford companion to New Zealand literature, edited by Roger Robinson and Nelson Wattie.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Te Aroha News was the first newspaper published in Te Aroha, in the Waikato. The town was relatively late in getting its own newspaper, as it was well served by papers published nearby in Thames.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first issue was published by HE Whitaker, on 9 June 1883, under the title Te Aroha News and Upper Thames Advocate. The paper was issued weekly. In 1884 ownership passed to John Ilott and the name changed to the Te Aroha and Ohinemuri News.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the next 40 years various other newspapers were published in Te Aroha; however none posed a serious threat to the News. The paper absorbed its main competitor, the Te Aroha Mail (1907-1918), in 1918.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1913 the Te Aroha News Company acquired the News and continued to publish the paper until 1982. In July that year the company went into receivership and the last issue of the paper came out on 17 September 1982. However, at the end of that month, a new paper with the same name began publishing in Te Aroha. This newspaper merged with the Piako Post in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

In 1866 another competitor appeared, the daily Nelson Evening Mail. For a period Nelson had three newspapers; two bi-weeklies and a daily. The Examiner ceased publication in 1874, leaving the field to the Colonist and Evening Mail. The Evening Mail became Nelson’s sole newspaper when it bought out the Colonist in 1920.

Its genesis was closely related to provincial politics, with one of the principal persons behind its establishment being Charles Brown, former Superintendent of the Taranaki Province. The News was set up as a rival to the Taranaki Herald, after the Herald successfully supported a rival candidate to Brown. The two newspapers remained strong rivals for over a century, although this did not prevent the News coming to the Herald’s assistance on more than one occasion when its production was affected by fire. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; During its early years the News suffered from a lack of funds; paper shortages also hampered production and on two occasions it had to print on dark blue packing paper. Frequent changes in ownership and management also hampered the development of the News and it did not really start to prosper until it was bought by Thomas List in 1905. List was a professional newspaper man, who had built up invaluable experience through his involvement with the Hutt and Petone Chronicle, the short-lived Wellington paper the Sun, and the Waimate Witness. Under List’s management, improvements to printing processes were made and branch offices were set up in Stratford and Hawera. When List took over the News he found that the newspaper was in the perilous position of having fewer than 200 regular paying subscribers. By the time of his death in 1934 circulation had expanded to such an extent that the News claimed it was the fifth largest morning newspaper in the country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After the Second World War, the News took advantage of improved transport links to extend its circulation into the King Country and came to be regarded as the regional paper, while the Herald was seen as a city and provincial paper. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ownership of the News and the Herald was merged in 1962 and much of their activity combined. However both papers retained their own editorial departments and competition between the old rivals continued to be keen. Eventually the Herald’s weaker circulation and advertising base, and its less favourable position as an evening paper, meant that it failed to outlast the News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The News has had various name changes over the years, with the most recent change being in August 2004 when the title changed back from the Daily News to the Taranaki Daily News. At the same time a picture of the region’s most well-known landmark, Mount Taranaki, was added to the masthead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Taranaki Daily News became part of the Fairfax group in 2003 and was still published as of 2014, making it the second oldest newspaper in the country after the Wanganui Chronicle. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Tētahi atu take i uaua ai te whanaketanga o te News ko ngā huringa o ngā kaipupuru hea me ngā kaiwhakahaere, ā, nō te hokonga o te niupepa e Thomas List i 1905 kātahi anō ka tino tupu ki tōna teitei. He kaimahi niupepa tūturu a List ā, i haria mai e ia ana tino mōhiotanga i ākona e ia i ana tau i te Hutt and Petone Chronicle, te niupepa rangitahi noa o Pōneke e mōhiotia nei ko te Sun, me te Waimate Witness.

Nō te ekenga o List hei kaiwhakahaere mō te News i kite ia kua hē te noho o te niupepa nā te mea he iti iho i te 200 ngā kaihoko auau i te niupepa. Ka tae ki te wā o tōna matenga i te tau 1934 kua whakawhānuitia te rere o te niupepa, i āhei ai te News ki te kī koia te tuarima o ngā niupepa ā-ata i te motu katoa, mō te maha o ana kaipānui. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I muri i te Pakanga Tuarua o te Ao, ka huri te News ki te whakapiki i ana mahi i runga i tana whakamahi i ngā hononga ā-huarahi, ā-tereina ki roto i te Rohe Pōtae, nō muri ka whakaarotia koia te niupepa ā-rohe, ā, ka kīa ko te Herald he niupepa ā-tāone, ā-rohe hoki. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I whakahanumitia ngā hea o te News me te Herald i te tau 1962 me te kōtuitanga o te tini o ngā mahi a tētahi, a tētahi. Ahakoa ko tērā, i waiho motuhake tonu ngā tari tuhi kaupapa o tētahi, o tētahi, me te haere tonu o te whakataetae nui i waenga i ngā hoa tauwhāinga o tau kē.

It was subsequently reported that the guest of honour, in response to effusive remarks, made his position quite clear. &amp;lsquo;He did not start the paper with the motive of patriotism, but as a commercial undertaking, and was prepared to give the district a fair trial, and to test its capabilities and willingness to support the paper .... If .... the district proved unable or unwilling to support the venture, he would abide by that verdict, and withdraw from the scene of action.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The support was there but, characteristically, Ivess was almost immediately eyeing other prospects and he sold the paper three months later to J J Utting, a Lyttelton Times reporter.&amp;nbsp; He, in turn, sold to another reporter, the Evening Post&amp;rsquo;s Jeremiah Twomey, in December 1881.&amp;nbsp; Twomey ran the paper, now tri-weekly, and the tri-weekly Geraldine Guardian, which he began in early 1883, from Temuka &amp;ndash; 18 kms south of Geraldine &amp;ndash; for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twomey sold to R R Martin in 1912 and Temuka mayor Colonel&amp;nbsp; Hayhurst was owner when he was killed in a car accident in August 1914.&amp;nbsp; According to the Auckland Star in January 1932 his widow &amp;lsquo;who, though having no interests in journalism, carried it on until now because it represented a local industry&amp;rsquo;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The closure of the two papers was announced in February 1932 but, with another company taking over, there was a reprieve for about a year. In March 1933 it was announced that &amp;lsquo;both newspapers will be incorporated with the South Canterbury Weekly Review, a new 16-page paper to be published by the same proprietors at Temuka.&amp;rsquo; They were &amp;lsquo;compelled to relinquish their usefulness to the district through the strong opposition of daily newspapers published in Timaru and Christchurch.&amp;rsquo; &amp;nbsp;The Weekly Review had a short life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The paper survived a number of controversies in its early years but the 1970s and 1980s were difficult times for evening newspapers and the Herald ceased publication in 1989.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Herald was started by William Collins and Garland William Woon. The first issue was published on 4 August 1852. In 1867 the paper was sold to Henry Weston. He was the sole owner till 1920. Various members of the Weston family were associated with the paper for most of its existence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Herald, like other newspapers in New Zealand in the mid 19th century, was involved in various controversies. In 1854 William Crompton, the subeditor, resigned after opinions he expressed in the paper, including the denouncing of marriages between Māori and Pakeha, aroused hostile criticism. In the provincial elections in 1857 the Herald transferred its support from the incumbent Superintendent Charles Brown to his rival George Cutfield. Cutfield won the election and Brown responded by setting up the Taranaki News to compete with the Herald. The editor of the Taranaki News was the former editor of the Herald, Richard Pheney. Pheney had resigned over the Herald withdrawing their support for Brown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1875 the Herald began publishing the Budget and Taranaki Weekly Herald. The Budget provided a synopsis of the news carried by the Herald each week and was intended mainly for rural readers who couldn't get the paper each day. The Budget lasted till 1932. In 1877 the Herald became a daily newspaper; the Taranaki News had become one two years before. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Herald became the oldest newspaper in New Zealand after the Lyttleton Times ceased publication in 1935. In 1962 it amalgamated with its old rival, the Taranaki News (now the Daily News). The papers retained separate editorial teams but shared everything else. The News was issued in the morning and the Herald in the evening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 1970s and 1980s it became increasingly difficult to maintain evening newspapers in New Zealand. The Herald was one of those affected and ceased publication in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Nō te tau 1854, ka tukua ai e William Crompton tōna tūnga ētita tuarua nō te kaha o te whakapae ki ana whakaaro i tuhia ki te nūpepa, pērā me tana whakahē i te moenga o te Māori ki te Pākehā. I ngā pōti porowini o te tau 1857 ka nukuhia te tautoko a te Herald mai i te Kaiwhakahaere o te wā, Charles Brown, ki tōna tāwhainga ki a George Cutfield. Ka riro i a Cutfield te pōti, ko te whakaūtunga i te Taranaki News hei tāwhainga i te Herald te whakautu a Brown. Ko te ētita o te Taranaki News te ētita o mua o te Herald, Richard Pheney.

Corlett, from Manchester in England, a compositor by training, also worked at the Southern Cross. The first issue of the tri-weekly Thames Advertiser and Miners’ News appeared in April 1868. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With the large influx of miners anxious for the latest goldfields news and gossip, the tri-weekly was an immediate success. Within the first year it became a daily and was the major newspaper in the Thames district during the main gold rush era. The bonanza years for the region were from 1868-1871, with impressive gold yields recorded. Gold production topped one million pounds sterling at its peak. The population of Thames built rapidly to 18,000 and it was, at the time, one of the largest towns in New Zealand. Commercial activity mushroomed and there were over 100 hotels vying for business. The Thames Advertiser thrived in terms of circulation, and advertising was particularly buoyant with hundreds of new businesses needing to promote their presence. There was also a similarly high demand for job printing. As in other gold-mining towns there was a demand for printing ‘scrip’ for mining companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Corlett withdrew from the partnership after a couple of years, briefly running a competing, short-lived daily, the Thames Guardian and Mining Record (1871-1872), before spending many years as manager of the Christchurch Press.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1872, Wilkinson was joined by Alfred Horton who had previously begun the Timaru Herald. Horton, who was to become the principal owner of Auckland’s New Zealand Herald, was a very experienced newspaper man and evidence of this was soon seen in the Thames Advertiser. However, Horton moved to Auckland in 1876 following a clash of editorial views. There was a succession of owners after Wilkinson sold the newspaper in the mid-1880s. William McCullough, who was associated with the rival newspaper, the Thames Evening Star (formerly Evening Mail) , purchased the Thames Advertiser in 1912 – and absorbed it into the Evening Star which, in due course, became the Thames Star. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

In the 1870s it was one of New Zealand’s most important newspapers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Herald was founded by Alfred George Horton and Ingram Shrimpton. The first issue was printed on 11 June 1864. Originally publication was weekly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Herald was set up to promote the interests of Timaru and Gladstone districts against those of the Canterbury province to which they belonged. People in the Timaru area thought they were not getting a fair share of the revenues collected by the provincial government. Horton’s involvement in this issue is very clear; he helped promote a bill in parliament setting up the Timaru and Gladstone Board of Works. This gave Timaru more control of expenditure on public works in the area and seems to have satisfied the local desire for independence from Canterbury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1866 the Herald became a bi-weekly, and in 1871 Horton sold to Herbert Belfield. Horton went on to become one of the most important newspaper publishers in New Zealand when, in 1876 he joined the Wilson family to create Wilson and Horton, the publishers of the New Zealand Herald for so many years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 1870s the Timaru Herald developed into a significant newspaper with a national reputation. This was largely due to the editor Edward Wakefield. Wakefield, the nephew of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, was an able and hard-hitting writer who was active in both local and national affairs. He was a Member of the House of Representatives in the 1870s and 1880s. As editor of the Herald he led campaigns that gained Timaru a port and waterworks. In parliament he had a reputation as a fierce debater but also for fickleness, which probably prevented him from achieving high office. In 1876 he was summoned to appear before the House of Representatives on a charge of breach of privilege after he wrote an article in the Herald that impugned the integrity of the current Members. The charges were dropped after Wakefield apologised to the House. During Wakefield’s term the paper began daily publication. He left the Herald in 1885 when he moved to Wellington.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the 1880s the Herald ran into financial difficulties. The Timaru Herald Company was formed to take over ownership with Herbert Belfield retained as the manager of the newspaper. In 1886 the paper was leased by its mortgagees to Joseph Ivess, an indefatigable founder and owner of newspapers in New Zealand in the 19th century. Ivess is reckoned to have started twenty-six newspapers; characteristically he did not stay with the Herald for long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1887 the paper was sold to Edward George Kerr. Kerr already owned another Timaru newspaper, the South Canterbury Times. Kerr ran the Times and the Herald from the same building, with the Herald published in the morning and the Times in the evening. The Times was closed in 1901 as part of a deal Kerr made with the other morning paper, the Timaru Post. Kerr persuaded the Post to switch to evening publication, becoming in effect the evening edition of the Herald. In 1923 the Herald began to subsidise the Post to keep it going. The Post ceased in 1939.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Kerr family owned and managed the Herald until the 1980s when it was sold to Independent Newspapers Limited (INL).&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Ko te Timaru Herald te nūpepa-ā-rangi ki Te Tihi-a-Maru. Kua rōnaki te tānga mai i te tau 1864. I te tekau tau mai i 1870 koia anō tētahi o ngā nūpepa hira rawa o Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I whakaūhia te Herald e Alfred George Horton rāua ko Ingram Shrimpton. Nō te 11 o Pipiri 1864 te tānga tuatahi. Kotahi tonu te rā tānga i ia wiki i te tīmatanga.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I whakatūria te Herald hei toko atu i ngā pānga o ngā takiwā o Te Tihi-a-Maru me Gladstone ki ērā o te rohe o ngā Pākihi-whakatekateka-a-Waitaha nāna nei rāua. Pēnei ana te iwi i te takiwā o Te Tihi-a-Maru kāhore tonu i te riro i a rātou te wāhanga tōtika o ngā whiwhinga i kohikohia e te kāwanatanga porowini. Kei te mārama te whakaurutanga o Horton ki tēnei kaupapa; nāna te tautoko i tētahi pire i te Whare Pāremata e whakatū ana i te Poari o ngā Mahinga ki Te Tihi-a-Maru me Gladstone. Koia anō a Te Tihi-a-Maru i whai mana ai i ngā whakapaunga mō ngā mahi tūmatanui i tērā takiwā; koia anō i ngata ai te hiahia o te iwi kāinga kia noho wehe kē i te rohe o Waitaha. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1866 ka rua ngā rā tānga o te Herald i ia wiki, ā, i te tau 1871 ka hokona e Horton ki a Herbert Belfield. Ka neke atu a Horton ka whanatu ko ia tētahi o ngā kaiwhakaputa nūpepa tino hira tonu o Aotearoa i tōna honotanga ki te whānau Wilson i te tau 1876, hei hanga i a Wilson and Horton, arā, te kamupene e whakaputa ana i te New Zealand Herald mō ētahi tau maha.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tekau tau mai i 1870 ka whanake te Timaru Herald hei nūpepa hira tonu, he rongo hoki tōna puta noa i te motu. Nā te ētita nā Edward Wakefield te tokonga ake o tēnei āhuatanga. Ko Wakefield, te irāmutu o Edward Gibbon Wakefield, ko tētahi kaituhi mātau, mārō hoki, he mātātoa ki ngā take ā-rohe, ki ngā take ā-motu hoki. He mema ia o te Whare Pāremata i waenganui i ngā tau 1870 me 1890. I a ia te ētita o te Herald, nāna tonu i ārahi ētahi whakamatāratanga i riro ai i a Te Tihi-a-Maru he poi, he pūnaha wai hoki. He kaitautohe muha tōna rongo ki te Whare Pāremata, otirā he matuarua, ā, nō konei pea te korenga nōna i eke ki te taumata. I te tau 1876 ka hāmenengia ia kia tū ki te aroaro o te Whare Pāremata i runga i te whakapae o ngā tikanga pāremata, i tana tuhinga i tētahi kōrero e uiui ana te ngākau tapatahi o ngā mema pāremata o te wā. I whakamakere ngā whakapae i te whakapāhatanga o Wakefield ki te Whare Pāremata. I tōna wā ka tīmata te tānga ā-rangi o te nūpepa. I mahue i a ia te Herald i te tau 1885 i tōna nekenga ki Pōneke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tekau tau mai i 1880 ka pā ki te Herald ētahi raruraru ā-moni. Ka whakatūria te Timaru Herald Company hei taumanu i te rangatiratanga, ā, puritia ana a Herbert Belfield hei kaiwhakahaere mō te nūpepa. I te tau 1886 ka rīhingia te nūpepa e ōna kaitango mōkete ki a Joseph Ivess, he kaiwhakaū nakawhiti, he rangatira anō hoki o ētahi nūpepa ki Aotearoa i te rau tau mai i 1800. E tatauria ana nā Ivess tonu i whakatū ētahi nūpepa rua tekau mā ono; i tōna āhua tonu kāhore i roa tana noho ki te Herald. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tau 1887 ka hokona te nūpepa ki a Edward George Kerr. Ko Kerr tonu te rangatira o tētahi atu nūpepa i te Tihi-a-Maru, o te South Canterbury Times. I whakahaeretia e Kerr te Times me te Herald i te whare kotahi, ā, ko te Herald i tāngia i te ata, ko te Times i te ahiahi. I katia te Times i te tau 1901 he wāhi o tētahi whaihanga nāna ki tētahi atu nūpepa o te ata, arā, te Timaru Post. Whakawherea ana te Post e Kerr kia whakawhiti ki te tānga i te ahiahi, noho noa ana koia tonu te tānga ahiahi o te Herald. I te tau 1923 ka tīmata te Herald ki te tuku pūtea āwhina i te Post kia haere tonu tērā. I mutu tonu te Post i te tau 1939.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko te whānau Kerr ngā rangatira, ko rātou tonu te whakahaere i te Herald tae atu ki te tekau tau mai i 1980, i tōna hokotanga ki te kamupene Independent Newspapers Limited (INL). &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

After his bankruptcy it was taken over by James Hopcraft (editor until his death in 1879) and William McCullough, amongst others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One innovation of the time was the use of messages sent by pigeon to deliver news reports, known as ‘pigeongrams’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1893 the daily paper became known as the Thames Star. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rival paper the Thames Advertiser was purchased by McCullough and incorporated into the Star in 1912.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Observer was one of a number of illustrated weekly newspapers that were popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Observer was probably not as popular or as well known as some of the other weeklies, e.g. the Weekly News, New Zealand Free Lance and the Otago Witness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Observer was first published in Auckland in 1880 by Alfred Stewart Rathbone, an English journalist who had been running the Bay of Plenty Times. The Observer's history is convoluted and closely interwoven with that of other Auckland newspapers of the 1870s and 1880s, particularly the Auckland Star.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Auckland Star started publishing in 1870. It was a liberal paper and set out to challenge the more conservative Evening News. One of the Star's owners, Henry Brett, was an important figure in the development of the press in New Zealand. He had worked for the Southern Cross and the New Zealand Herald as well as publishing a number of popular and influential periodicals besides the Star. He was also a director and chairman of the Press Association and an original member of the Newspaper Proprietors Association.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Star was popular and successful from its inception, despite having a number of rivals in the 1870s and 1880s. In addition to the Observer these also included the Free Lance, set up by John Dickson Wickham in 1879.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1884 the Observer's publishers put out the Evening Telephone to compete with the Star. However this paper soon proved a financial drain and in 1885 John Wickham acquired both the Telephone and the Observer merging them with the Free Lance and retaining the Observer name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the demise of the Telephone came the Evening Bell (first published on 12 May 1885), which lasted three years before Brett bought it and the Observer. Having incorporated the Bell, Brett sold the Observer in 1889.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 1890s the paper was called the New Zealand Observer and Free Lance. It became well established in the 1890s and similar publications were started in Christchurch (the Spectator) and Wellington (the New Zealand Free Lance).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like the other pictorial weeklies, the paper went into decline in the first half of the 20th century and stopped publishing in November 1954.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Kāore rā pea i ōrite te paingia, te rongonui rānei ki ō ētahi atu nūpepa ā-wiki pērā me te Weekly News, New Zealand Free Lance, me te Otago Witness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I whakaputaina tuatahitia i ākarana i te tau 1880 e Alfred Stewart Rathbone, he kairīpoata Pākehā nāna te Bay of Plenty Times i whakahaere.

I whakakapia Te Toa Takitini e Te Reo o Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I roto i ngā āpiti i whakaputaina i te taha o Nama 37 &amp;ndash; 42 ko ngā waiata me ngā whakamārama o ngā pūtakenga me ngā kōrero āpiti mō ngā kaitito o aua waiata. I whakaputaina ngātahitia ā muri ake e te Polynesian Society i roto i Ngā Mōteatea e A T Ngata me Pei Te Hurinui Jones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I tuhia tēnei pepa ki te reo Māori.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;E hiahia ana te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa ki te mihi ki a Gail Dallimore mōna i tuku kōrero mai i whakamahia i roto i ngā tuhinga roa mō ngā niupepa Māori.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand&lt;/em&gt; is one of New Zealand&amp;#39;s most important research publications, particularly for science. Contributors to the Transactions include James Hector, William Colenso, Charles Fleming, Thomas Hocken, and Ernest Rutherford.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Royal Society (known as the New Zealand Institute before 1933) was established in 1867 to co-ordinate and assist the activities of a number of regional research societies including the Auckland Institute, the Wellington Philosophical Society and the Otago Institute. These societies often did not have the means to publish the papers that were presented to them or maintain a written record of their activities. The NZ Institute was set up to remedy this through the publication of a single volume of transactions and proceedings on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt; contain the papers read before the member societies and the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; record the business of the Royal Society and its affiliates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first volume, published in 1869, included the papers presented in 1868. The &lt;em&gt;Transactions and Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; followed this pattern, with some variations until 1961. These variations include the re-publication in 1875 of a revised edition of the first volume; the separate publication of the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; for v41-v44; quarterly and annual publication of the Transactions from v58.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt; were split in 1961 into separate series for zoology, botany, geology and general. The &lt;em&gt;Proceedings&lt;/em&gt;, which had been published separately since 1958 with the same numbering as the &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt;, continued till 1996.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Royal Society has since 1910 published, irregularly, a monographic series entitled the &lt;em&gt;Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; for papers that were too large for the &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt; initially covered a wide range of subjects. While science has always predominated a report in 1891 showed that about 20% of the papers published up to then were in the areas of ethnography, agriculture, history and literature. However by the 1920&amp;#39;s the &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt; were exclusively scientific, with particular focus on botany, zoology and geology. This change was due, in part, to the emergence of other research publications such as the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Polynesian Society&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NZ journal of agriculture&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;NZ journal of science and technology&lt;/em&gt; to provide outlets for research. Dissatisfaction with the &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt; may have encouraged the establishment of other research journals. There was frequent criticism from some of the societies affiliated to the Royal Society about the slowness with which the &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt; were published.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The content of the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; also varied over the years. The full proceedings of the member societies and the parent body weren&amp;#39;t always included every year. In the 1950&amp;#39;s they started to included articles and reports relating to other scientific organisations that the Society was involved with such as the International Council of Science Unions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information about the &lt;em&gt;Transactions and Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; see, Charles Fleming, &lt;em&gt;Science, settlers and scholars : the centennial history of the Royal Society of New Zealand&lt;/em&gt; (1987).&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Ko te &lt;em&gt;Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand&lt;/em&gt; tētahi o ngā whakaputanga rangahau hira rawa o Aotearoa, otirā mō te pūtaiao. Ko ētahi o ngā kaituku ki te Transactions ko James Hector, William Colenso, Charles Fleming, Thomas Hocken, me Ernest Rutherford.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I whakatūhia Te Apārangi (e mōhiotia ana ko te New Zealand Institute i mua o te 1933) i te tau 1867 ki te whakarite me te āwhina i ngā mahi a ngā rōpū rangahau ā-rohe maha, tae atu ki te Auckland Institute, te Wellington Philosophical Society me te Otago Institute. I te nuinga o te wā kāore i taea e ēnei rōpū te whakaputa i ngā pepa i whakaaturia ki a rātau, te pupuri tuhinga kōrero mō ā rātau mahi. I whakatūhia te NZ Institute hei rongoā i tēnei mā te whakaputa i tētahi pukapuka kotahi o ngā whakawhitinga me ngā whakahaere mō rātau.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kei roto i te &lt;em&gt;Transactions &lt;/em&gt;ko ngā pepa i pānuitia e ngā rōpū mema, ā, ko tā te &lt;em&gt;Proceedings &lt;/em&gt;he tuhi i ngā mahi a Te Apārangi me ōna hoa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I roto i te pukapuka tuatahi, i whakaputaina i te tau 1869, ko ngā pepa i whakaaturia i te tau 1868. I whai te &lt;em&gt;Transactions and Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; i tēnei tauira, me ētahi rerekētanga atu ki te tau 1961. Kei roto i ēnei rerekētanga ko te whakaputa anō i te tau 1871 i tētahi putanga hou o te pukapuka tuatahi; te whakaputanga motuhake o te &lt;em&gt;Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; mō te p41-p44; te whakaputanga hauwhā, ā-tau hoki o &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt; mai i te p58.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wehea te&lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt; i te tau 1961 ki ngā tāuhu motuhake mō te mātai kīrehe, mātai tipu, mātai aronuku me ngā āhuatanga whānui. I haere tonu atu te &lt;em&gt;Proceedings&lt;/em&gt;, i whakaputaina motuhaketia mai i te tau 1958 me ngā whakatatau ōrite ki &lt;em&gt;te Transactions&lt;/em&gt;, tae atu ki te tau 1996.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kua whakaputaina tipihoritia e Te Apārangi mai i te tau 1910, tētahi tāuhu whakamāramatanga e kīia ana ko te &lt;em&gt;Bulletin &lt;/em&gt;mō ngā pepa he nui rawa mō te&lt;em&gt;Transactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tuatahi i kapi i te&lt;em&gt; Transactions&lt;/em&gt; ngā kaupapa maha whānui. Ahakoa ko te pūtaiao te kaupapa matua, i kitea i tētahi pūrongo i te tau 1891 tata ki te 20% o ngā pepa i whakaputaina ki taua wā i roto i ngā wāhanga o te mātauranga tangata, ahuwhenua, hītori me te mātauranga tuhituhinga. Engari i ngā tau 1920 he pūtaiao anake te &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt;, me te aro nui ki te mātai tipu, mātai kīrehe me te mātai aronuku. Ko te tikanga o tēnei huringa, nā te putanga haere o ētahi atu whakaputanga rangahau, pēnei i te &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Polynesian Society&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NZ journal of agriculture&lt;/em&gt; me te &lt;em&gt;NZ journal of science and technology&lt;/em&gt; hei whakaputanga mō ngā rangahau. Nā te whakaahunga ki te &lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt; i ara pea ētahi atu rīpoata rangahau. He rite te puta o ngā whakahē mai i ētahi o ngā rōpū e hāngai ana ki Te Apārangi mō te pōturi o te whakaputa i te &lt;a name="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transactions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I rerekē haere ngā ihirangi o te &lt;em&gt;Proceedings &lt;/em&gt;i roto i ngā tau. Kāore i uru katoa ia tau ngā whakahaere katoa a ngā mema rōpū me te rōpū matua. I te ngā tau o te 1950 i tīmata ki te whakauru tuhinga me ngā pūrongo e pā ana ki ētahi atu rōpū pūtaiao i roto i Te Apārangi pēnei i te International Council of Science Unions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mō ētahi atu kōrero mō te &lt;em&gt;Transactions and Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; tirohia, Charles Fleming, &lt;em&gt;Science, settlers and scholars : the centennial history of the Royal Society of New Zealand&lt;/em&gt; (1987).&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The first Europeans began to settle the Te Puke Block in 1879. Flax milling started up in the area in the 1870s and was a major industry until the early 1940s. Saw milling began in 1905 and has remained a major industry. After the swamps in the area were drained the land was found to be very suitable for crops, and maize and wheat were grown extensively. Pastoral farming was less successful until the use of cobalt, in the 1930s, cured animals’ ‘bush sickness’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first issue of the Te Puke Times was published on February 6 1912. A week later Wellington’s Evening Post reported that ‘the first issue of the Te Puke Times is to hand, and is a creditable production’. The paper was owned and edited by Thomas H Wilsone, born in Masterton and a journalist on the Wairarapa Star before a period farming with a brother. He moved north to become part owner and editor of the Waikato Independent in Cambridge in 1910. A year later the paper was sold to the Waikato Publishing Co and Wilsone relocated his newspaper ambitions to Te Puke. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the first issue of the Te Puke Times, Wilsone wrote: ‘We have been encouraged to take this step recognising the manifold signs of future progress which are everywhere apparent .... We hold that a well conducted journal must always exercise a certain influence for good in a community, not only in a material but in a moral sense, that its duty is not only to expose abuses but to give every encouragement to all projects initiated for the elevation of the social life of a community.’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The one penny paper appeared twice weekly and lived up to its promise, in common with many small-town publications of the time, of providing local news in great detail. There were lengthy articles about weddings, debutante balls and farewells, with detailed descriptions of gifts given and dresses worn. Overseas trips by local identities were given extensive coverage; visitors to the area were interviewed. There was extensive coverage of sporting events, A &amp; P Shows and, in later years, the activities of the Women’s Institute and Women’s Division.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thomas Wilsone continued as proprietor and editor until his death in 1936, when his wife, Edith Wilsone, promoted Frederick Gemming, employed since 1919, to run the paper. Gemming leased the paper in 1939 until 1941. After ill health forced his retirement, Edith Wilsone took control for less than a year before selling the Te Puke Times to Philip Basham. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Basham served a six year printing apprenticeship at the Waikato Independent in Cambridge before joining the Hot Lakes Chronicle in Rotorua. Later, he moved to Auckland, where he ran an Otahuhu weekly, and then in 1934, to Taranaki, becoming managing director of the bi-weekly Inglewood Times. Newsprint shortages were common during the Second World War and, when a critical paper delivery by train failed to arrive, the 27 November 1942 edition of the Te Puke Times was a single 17cm x 6cm sheet – possibly the country’s smallest ever newspaper – to inform readers of an important farewell function the next night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After Philip Basham died in 1963 his son David continued to run the paper. In 1978 Basham and two colleagues purchased the Bay Sun, with a free Tauranga area circulation, incorporating it with the Te Puke Times. The Tuesday edition of the combined paper included Te Puke news, but this satisfied neither readers or advertisers and, in 1982, the Te Puke Times masthead and full local content were restored. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1983 the company was sold to John Wood and, in 1985, to NZ News Ltd. In 1989, Independent News Ltd (INL) bought part of NZ News, including the Te Puke Times and a number of other community newspapers. In 2002 Wilson and Horton, now APN NZ Ltd, purchased the paper from Independent Community Newspapers (INL). The free weekly is now published by the Bay of Plenty Times and is one of the APN News &amp; Media stable of community newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Ko tēnei niupepa he pepa nā Thomas H Wilsone, he tangata i whānau mai i Māhitaone, he kaituhi hoki i te Wairarapa Star i mua i tana haere ki te pāmu whenua me tana teina. Ka nuku whaka-te-raki ia kia eke hei kaipupuri i tētahi wāhi o te Waikato Independent hei etita hoki, i Kēmureti i te tau 1910. Kotahi tau i muri mai ka hokona te niupepa ki te Waikato Publishing Co ā, ka whakahokia e Wilsone ana moemoeā mō tētahi niupepa ki Te Puke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te rerenga tuatahi o te Te Puke Times ka tuhi a Wilsone: “I hīkaka ai mātou ki te whakatutuki i tēnei moemoeā i runga i tā mātou titiro ki te ahunga whakamua o te ao he mārama ki te titiro a te kanohi, i ngā wāhi katoa.... E mea ana mātou ko tēnei mea te niupepa whai take me kawe ngā whakaaro ki te pai, i tōna takiwā, kaua ki te pai kikokiko anake, engari ki te pai wairua, otirā ko te pīkauranga nui o tēnei mea te niupepa kia kaua e mutu noa i te hura i ngā mahi hē anake, engari kia hāpainga ngā kaupapa katoa e whāia ana hei whakapiki i te pai o te noho o te katoa.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; E rua ngā putanga o tēnei niupepa kotahi kapa ia wiki, ā, i tutuki katoa ngā tūmanako, rite tonu ki te nuinga noa iho o ngā niupepa tāone iti o taua wā, i horaina ai te tini o ngā pitopito kōrero ā-rohe, me te pai o ngā tuhinga. He roa tonu ngā tuhinga mō ngā mārena, mō ngā pō kanikani nui, mō ngā whakaputanga puhi o te rohe, ngā poroporoaki, me ngā whakamārama roa tonu o ngā perehana i takoto, me ngā panekoti i mauria. He roa tonu ngā pūrongo whakamārama mō ngā haerenga ki tāwāhi a ngā tāngata o te rohe; he hōhonu tonu anō hoki ngā uiuinga ki ngā manuhiri ki te takiwā. He maha ngā pūrongo mō ngā taumāhekeheke, mā ngā Whakakitenga A &amp; P, ā, i ngā tau o muri, ngā mahi a te Women’s Institute me te Women’s Division. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I noho tonu a Thomas Wilsone hei rangatira, hei etita hoki taea noatia tōna matenga i te tau 1936, i reira ka whakapikia a Frederick Gemming, e te pouaru e Edith Wilsone hei kaiwhakahaere mō te niupepa. He kaimahi ia mai o te tau 1919. Ka rīhitia te pepa e Gemming i te tau 1939 tae noa ki te tau 1941. Ka pāngia e te mate, ka tukua e ia tana tūranga, ā, ka whakahaeretia e Edith Wilsone mō te wā, kāore i eke ki te tau, kātahi ka hokona te Te Puke Times ki a Philip Basham. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I noho a Basham hei pia mō ngā mahi tā pukapuka mō te ono tau i te Waikato Independent i Kēmureti i mua i tana hononga ki te Hot Lakes Chronicle i Rotorua, mahi ai. Nō muri mai ka nuku ki Tāmaki-makau-rau, i whakahaeretia e ia tētahi wīkiri ki Ōtāhuhu, ā, i te tau 1934, ka nuku ki Taranaki, ka noho hei kaiwhakahaere matua mō te Inglewood Times, e rua ōna putanga i te wiki. He maha ngā korekorenga pepa niupepa i te wā o Te Pakanga Tuarua o Te Ao, ā, i te korenga o te tino tereina me ngā pūkei pepa hei tānga e tae mai, he hīti kotahi noa te putanga o te 27 o ngā rā o Nōema 1942 o te Te Puke Times, e 17cm x 6cm te rahi. Koinei pea te niupepa iti rawa kia puta i Aotearoa, - hei whakamōhio i ngā kaipānui mō tētahi poroporoaki nui ka tū i te aonga ake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I muri i te matenga o Philip Basham i te tau 1963 nā tana tama nā David i kawe whakamua te niupepa. Nō te tau 1978 nā Basham me ētahi o ana hoa tokorua i hoko te Bay Sun, he tohanga noa tōna ki te takiwā o Tauranga, ā, ka whakahanumitia ki te Te Puke Times. I roto i te putanga o ia Tūrei ngā pitopito kōrero o Te Puke, engari kāore ngā kaipānui me ngā kaituku pānui i rata ki tēnei āhua, ā, nō te tau 1982 ka whakarewaina anō te ingoa me ngā kai katoa o te rohe o te Te Puke Times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te tau 1983 ka hokona te kamupene ki a John Wood ā, i te tau 1985, ki NZ News Ltd. I te tau 1989, nā Independent News Ltd (INL) i hoko tētahi wāhi o NZ News, tae atu ki te Te Puke Times me ētahi atu niupepa ā-rohe. Nō te tau 2002 nā Wilson and Horton, e mōhiotia nei ko APN NZ Ltd ināianei, i hoko te niupepa mai i Independent Community Newspapers (INL). He mea whakaputa te wikiri hoatu noa e te Bay of Plenty Times koia hoki tētahi o te kāhui niupepa ā-rohe a APN News &amp; Media. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Star began publication as the evening edition of the Lyttelton Times on 14 May 1868.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Star established itself as a reliable but unremarkable newspaper. Probably the most noteworthy thing the Star did in its early years was to bring out a Saturday night sports edition which immediately became popular. Things livened up for the Star in 1914 with the publication of a rival evening paper, the Sun. The Sun was a new type of newspaper in New Zealand. Modelled on the London Daily Mail it had a bright layout, heavy use of illustrations and an independent attitude. It was immediately popular with the public. Christchurch was now overburdened with newspapers - there were three evening, two morning and two weekly newspapers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first casualty was the Evening News which ceased in 1917. The depression brought further need for rationalisation and competition intensified. In November 1934 the Star dropped its price from 2d to 1d. The other dailies in Christchurch soon followed. As a result there was demand for Christchurch papers outside Canterbury and eventually most South Island papers reduced their price. The price cutting proved unsustainable and, in June 1935, the Christchurch morning papers agreed to raise the price back to 2d. However the struggle continued between the Sun and the Star. The conflict was settled with help from the Newspaper Proprieters Association. New Zealand Newspapers Ltd, the owners of the Star and the Lyttelton Times (now called the Christchurch Times), purchased the Sun and agreed to cease publication of the Times. The Press Co. purchased the goodwill of the Times. In June 1935 the Sun was incorporated into the Star and became a new newspaper called the Christchurch Star-Sun. In the same month the Christchurch Times ceased, leaving Christchurch with one morning paper, the Press and one evening paper, the Star-Sun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Star-Sun changed title several times and was called the Christchurch Star when it ceased daily publication in 1991. The Star continues to be published as a bi-weekly community newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Tērā pea ko te mea rongonui o ōna tau tuatahi te tānga i tētahi wāhanga hākinakina, i tōna putanga mai tonu, i pai wawe ki te iwi. Nō te tau 1914, nō te putanga o te tāwhainga pepa ahiahi te Sun ka whakaohongia ake ai te Star. Ko te Sun he tūmomo nūpepa hou ki Niu Tīreni. Ko tōna tauira ko te London Daily Mail, he whakatakotoranga kānapanapa, kikī ana i te whakaahua, me te waiaro wehe kē. He tere pai ki te iwi whānui i tana putanga. Ka maha rawa ngā nūpepa o Ōtautahi i taua wā - e toru mō te ahiahi, e rua mō te ata, e rua ia wiki.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko te aituā tuatahi ko te Evening News i mutu i te tau 1917. He pūtake whakawhāiti mai i te pōuritanga, ā, ka kaha ake te tāwhainga. Nō te marama o Noema o te tau 1934 ka whakahekea te utu o te Star mai i 2d ki te 1d. Kātahi ka whāia e ērā o ngā nūpepa ia rā o Ōtautahi. Te mutunga iho he hiahia i waho o Ngā Pākihi-whakatekateka-a-Waitaha (Canterbury) ki ngā nūpepa o Ōtautahi, kātahi ka iti ake te utu o te nuinga o ngā nūpepa o Te Waipounamu. Kāore i taea te mauroa i te itinga iho o te utu, ā, nō te marama o Hune o te tau 1935, ka whakaaea e ngā nūpepa ata o Ōtautahi te whakahoki i te utu ki te 2d. Heoi anō, ka haere tonu te tāwhainga i waenga i te Sun me te Star. I tau te puehu i te āwhina mai a te Rōpū o ngā Rangatira Nūpepa (Newspaper Proprietors' Association). Nā New Zealand Newspapers Ltd, ngā rangatira o te Star me te Lyttelton Times (ko te Christchurch Times tōna ingoa hou), te Sun i hoko, ā, ka whakaaea te katinga o te Times. Nā te Press Co. te kaingākaunui o te Times i hoko. Nō te marama o Hune o te tau 1935 ka whakakotahitia te Sun me te Star hei nūpepa hou, te Christchurch Star-Sun. Nō taua marama anō, ka katia ai te Christchurch Times ka noho kia kotahi noa te nūpepa ata o Ōtautahi, te Press, me tētahi mea ahiahi, te Star-Sun. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He maha ngā ingoa o te Star-Sun, ā, koia te Christchurch Star i tōna mutunga hei nūpepa ia-rā i te tau 1991. Kei te haere tonu te Star hei nūpepa hapori e rua tānga ki te wiki.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The only hint that it was about to cease publication was an editorial in the last issue exhorting the public to support local newspapers in general. The paper probably succumbed to shortages of paper and labour due to the War and the death, three years before, of its long-serving manager, John Norrie. In this the Times wasn’t alone: many other country newspapers in New Zealand shut up shop at this time for want of resources. It is likely that the paper had struggled for years to remain open.

In 1881 the Times was bought by Thomas and Richard Pilling. They published it till 1896 when it was sold to the Tuapeka Times Company, managed by John Norrie.

It had only published bi-weekly since 1873 and with usually no more than four pages to an issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nature of the Times’ demise contrasts with its early years when the paper was at the centre of the gold boom in Central Otago. Gabriel’s Gully, the site of New Zealand’s most significant gold find, was nearby. The Times was a product of the boom and the issues from this time are an essential resource for the study of New Zealand’s history in the mid nineteenth century, when the gold from this area made Otago the leading province in the colony.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; The Victoria Times was only published once but is noteworthy for several reasons; it was Wellington's second earliest paper, it was lithographed rather than letter-pressed and it contains a plan of Wellington on the back page. The plan was hand-coloured in some issues although not the one presented here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Victoria Times was published by Thomas Bluett and Jacob Jones. They had previously produced lithographs for the New Zealand Company, including a chart of Port Nicholson that's now recognized as New Zealand's first lithograph. Given that the Company had a strong interest in Wellington’s other newspaper, the New Zealand Gazette, the decision to publish a rival paper seems reckless. And is presumably one of the reasons why the paper failed to appear again. Another possible reason for the paper’s brief life was that the partnership of Bluett and Jones did not endure. Jones announced its dissolution in the Gazette in late 1841. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bluett moved to Tasmania. Records show him operating a lithographic firm in Hobart in 1842. Examples of his work are held in various archives in Australia. He died in England in 1846. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

It is possible, although difficult to confirm, that the paper was started by Joseph Ivess, ‘ragplanter’ extraordinaire. If he was involved, it was not a lengthy association because the Wairarapa Star was soon in the hands of printer J Smith and editor Alexander W Hogg. Smith and Hogg ran the paper until 1892. A W Renall, a prominent local businessman and politician, who shared Hogg’s liberal views, was also involved. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alexander Hogg emigrated with his family from Scotland to Australia, where he had some newspaper experience, before crossing the Tasman about 1876. He worked in various capacities on the Otago Guardian, Ashburton Mail and South Canterbury Times before moving to Masterton in 1884. Under his editorship, the Wairarapa Star took a strongly liberal position, supporting the small settler and advocating universal education. He won the Masterton parliamentary seat for the Liberals in 1890, and was briefly in cabinet in 1910. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1892 the newspaper was sold to William C Cargill who ran it for a decade. In 1897, The Cyclopedia of New Zealand’s Wellington Provincial edition noted that ‘fourteen to twenty hands are employed in the composing, machining and delivering of the dailies and weekly.’ It also recorded that ‘Mr. Cargill has been successful in his management of the Star, which has espoused the Liberal cause freely and forcibly.’ After leaving the Wairarapa in 1902 he published several newspapers in the Waikato region.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Arthur C Major, who had previously been on the staff of the New Zealand Herald in Auckland and also edited the Wairarapa Observer, took control of the newspaper. As sole proprietor and editor, he quickly shifted publication to mornings and renamed the paper the Wairarapa Age. In 1907, the publishing and printing business became a private company. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1910 Arthur Major changed career – training as a lawyer – and the company was sold to James Brown, formerly editor, manager and then part owner of the Wairarapa Observer, a daily published in Carterton. When he died in 1913, his son, E James Brown, became managing director and A H Vile was editor for a number of years. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Wairarapa Age building burnt down in October 1918, a repeat of a similar major setback in 1896. Linotype machines and printing presses were destroyed, and for a period the paper was printed by its evening competitor. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1921, the Wairarapa Age Co Ltd, with a capital of £10,300 (about $870,000 today), was floated to buy the newspaper. Guy H Scholefield, a part-owner and director, was appointed editor. Scholefield had been London correspondent of New Zealand Associated Press, serving a consortium of New Zealand metropolitan newspapers from 1908, and a war correspondent during World War One. In 1926 he left the Wairarapa Age to become Parliamentary Librarian in Wellington, and subsequently authored a number of significant books. He was succeeded as editor by W A Michael. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1938, the two Masterton dailies joined forces as the Wairarapa Times-Age, published as an evening daily. Michael was editor of the merged newspaper until he retired in 1957. In 2002, the Wairarapa Times-Age was purchased by Wilson &amp; Horton which was subsequently acquired by APN News &amp; Media. In 2011 the paper moved to morning publication and a tabloid format. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

I mahi anō ia i ētahi mahi i te Otago Guardian, Ashburton Mail me te South Canterbury Times i mua i tana nekehanga mai ki Te Oreore i te tau 1884.

I riro i a ia te tūnga o Te Oreore i te whare pāremata mō te rōpū Liberal i te tau 1890, ā, i uru hoki ki te rūnanga o te kāwanatanga mō te wā poto i te tau 1910. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I te tau 1892 ka hokona te nūpepa ki a William C Cargill ā, ka whakahaeretia e ia mō te ngahuru tau. I te tau 1897, ka puta te kī a te Wellington Provincial o te Cyclopedia of New Zealand ‘mai i te tekau mā whā ki te rua tekau ngā kaimahi e whakamahia ana ki te tāpae pū, ki te whakahaere mīhini me te tohatoha i ngā nūpepa ā-rā, ā-wiki ki ngā kaipānui.' I puta hoki te kī he rawe te whakahaere a ‘Mr. Cargill i te Star, he nūpepa kauwhau tikanga mō te taha whakaaro ngāwari, i runga i te māia me te mātātoa.’ Ka wehe atu i Wairarapa i te tau 1902 ā, ka whakatūria e ia ētahi nūpepa i te rohe o Waikato. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I riro te mana whakahaere i te nūpepa i a Arthur C Major, he kaimahi nō mua i te New Zealand Herald i Tāmakimakaurau, he ētita hoki i te Wairarapa Observer.

Ka whakatūngia a Guy H Scholefield, rangatira o tētahi wāhi o ana hea, kaitohutohu hoki, hei ētita. He kaituhi a Scholefield mai i Rānana mō te New Zealand Associated Press, e tuhi ana mō tētahi kāpuinga nūpepa ā-tāone o Aotearoa mai i te tau 1908, ā, he kaituhi mai i te pakanga i te Pakanga Tuatahi o Te Ao.

Bond quickly converted the three-morning-a-week Waikato Times into a penny evening daily, with the Waikato Argus beginning and continuing as a tri-weekly morning paper. In 1898, with high public interest following the outbreak of the Spanish-American war, the Argus had no alternative but to also join the Press Association.&amp;nbsp; As it was unable to make suitable telephone arrangements, the Argus changed to evening publication &amp;ndash; and Hamilton had two evening papers with virtually identical international news.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the 1902 Auckland provincial edition of the Cyclopedia of New Zealand, the Argus&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;/em&gt;columns are largely devoted to the interests of the farmers&amp;rsquo;.&amp;nbsp; It became a daily in 1899.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1909, following a fire at the Times, the Argus produced both papers for a period with, as a later report noted, &amp;lsquo; ... the one being almost an exact duplicate of the other so far as the news columns went, with merely a change of title.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first decade of the 20th century was difficult economically for the competing publications &amp;ndash; and at the beginning of the First World War a company was formed to buy both papers. &amp;nbsp;In late 1914 the Argus was incorporated into the much older Waikato Times. George Edgecumbe was the new company&amp;rsquo;s chairman of directors for some years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first and only editor of the Waikato Argus was Henry Holloway. An Englishman, he arrived in New Zealand in 1863. He was a miner and served in the Taranaki militia before settling in Wanganui and becoming editor of the Wanganui Herald.&amp;nbsp; He was later on the staff of the Wellington Independent and the Napier Daily Telegraph before becoming the first editor of the Waikato Times. About 20 years later, after a period in Australia, he was again editor of the Waikato Times when George Edgecumbe&amp;rsquo;s lease was not renewed. He immediately joined the Argus and remained editor until its 1914 amalgamation with the Times.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;From the early 1880s, there was constant newspaper competition in Cambridge, about 22 kms south-east of Hamilton.&amp;nbsp; After &amp;lsquo;ragplanter&amp;rsquo; Joseph Ivess launched the tri-weekly Waikato Mail in September 1880 he, typically, moved on a few months later, but the paper survived until early 1882. Cambridge&amp;rsquo;s next paper, the bi-weekly Waikato Gazette and Thames Valley Recorder, appeared in late June 1883. In 1885, it was replaced by the tri-weekly Cambridge News which published until 1892-1893. About two years later, in July 1895, J S Bond, printer and mayor of Cambridge, launched the weekly Waikato Advocate. Barely a year later, it was absorbed into the Waikato Times when Bond purchased the Hamilton paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another eight years passed before Cambridge had its next newspaper, the tri-weekly Waikato Independent.&amp;nbsp; When it was launched on 15 November 1904 by David Pirani, previously co-owner, with his brother Frederick, of the Manawatu Standard, the Free Lance reported: &amp;lsquo; ....the Piranis are all Left-wingers &amp;ndash; worked for some years in the composing-room of the Government Printing Office .... When he dropped out of the Palmerston Standard it was the intention of Mr. Pirani to retire &amp;ndash; a rare experience for a printer &amp;ndash; but apparently he feels too young for a &amp;lsquo;has been&amp;rsquo;, hence his coming activities in the Waikato.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The eight-page paper appeared on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Pirani sold to Reginald Pyke, formerly owner of Milton&amp;rsquo;s Bruce Herald&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; in May 1906. He, in turn, sold four years later and returned to the Bruce Herald. Between 1911 and 1920 the Waikato Publishing Company owned the paper and for the next decade Frank Penn, Otaki Mail owner, was the proprietor. In late 1930 Charles Vennell became the Waikato Independent editor when a company he was the minority shareholder in bought the newspaper.

There was a change of name to the Cambridge Independent in 1966 and the paper finally closed in April 1995.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

It was extraordinary that any Greytown-based paper survived at all during the early settler years. Apart from the heavy bush still to be converted into pasture and the regular flooding of the nearby Waiohine River, Greytown’s population had struggled to only 479 souls six years after the paper was launched.

It was extraordinary that any Greytown-based paper survived at all during the early settler years. Apart from the heavy bush still to be converted into pasture and the regular flooding of the nearby Waiohine River, Greytown’s population had struggled to only 479 souls six years after the paper was launched. Contact with the other townships in the valley was difficult and hazardous given the rivers and streams to cross and rudimentary roads. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The newspaper had, in fact, been foreshadowed eighteen months earlier. It was announced in the Evening Post of 4 August 1865 that a new weekly, the Wairarapa Mercury, ‘advocating the local interests of the Wairarapa, free from class predilections and party bias’, would be published shortly in Greytown ‘under the management of Mr R Wakelin’. Four days later the Wellington Independent added its comment about Richard Wakelin: ‘....from the ability of the editor, as well as his lengthened connection with the Press, we have no doubt, but that our embryo contemporary, when started, will prove a valuable journal ....’ Later widely known as the ‘father of New Zealand journalism’, Wakelin had edited the Wellington Independent between 1852-1859. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the event, the embryo had a long gestation, and the paper did not appear until the first Saturday in January 1867. The paper was started by Edward and Charles Grigg, who had previously worked for the Wellington Independent. Wakelin assisted editorially until November. At the beginning of 1868 he began the bi-weekly Wairarapa Journal which, when he found the enterprise unprofitable, morphed into the Wellington Journal, published in the capital until it, too, ceased later in the year. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Like many early papers, the Wairarapa Mercury was badly affected by fires. After the second, on 19 November 1868, Archibald Arnot, who had become sole owner, manager and editor, was able to buy from Richard Wakelin the Albion double demy machine that had printed the Wellington Journal and to continue publishing with only a month’s break. The paper continued until early August 1872, when Arnot was committed for trial for embezzlement. He sold the paper to a Mr Hirschberg and, it was reported, committed suicide the same month. Hirschberg promptly sold the paper to Richard Wakelin, who became sole proprietor and editor, and published the first issue of the re-named, twice weekly Wairarapa Standard on 19 August. The Wellington Independent commented rather tartly that: ‘it evidently aims at a higher standard than its predecessor ever did’. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Several months later, Wakelin’s son-in-law Joseph Payton, a school teacher, joined him for six years, before launching the Wairarapa Daily in Masterton. With assistance, Wakelin continued to run the Standard, which at times appeared three times a week. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; On his death in 1881 the Wanganui Herald noted that he was ‘always a consistent Liberal in politics, being one of the firmest defenders of an open and honest system of land administration ..... and a vigorous defender of Sir George Grey, whose policy in the early days he ably upheld ....’. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Wairarapa Standard was subsequently owned by William C Nation and a brother before William F Roydhouse bought the paper in 1893. Later owners included the Nicol brothers, and Thomas McCracken. After a further fire in 1937, the Standard was printed in Masterton, surviving as a tri-weekly and through further ownership changes until 1942. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; Ko te Wairarapa Mercury te niupepa tuatahi o Wairarapa. I whakarewaina i Kereitāone, te tāone tuawhenua tuatahi o Aotearoa, i te marama o Hānuere 1867. He mea tino whakamīharo kia ora mai he niupepa i te tāone o Kereitāone i ngā tau tuatahi o te noho mai a te Pākehā i taua rohe. He ngahere mātotoru i ngā wāhi katoa o Wairarapa, me mātua waere hei pāmu, he rite tonu te waipuke o te awa o Waiohine i te taha o te tāone. Nā ēnei āhuatanga e 479 noa iho te taupori o Kereitāone, e ono tau i muri i tōna whakarewanga. He uaua tonu te whakapā haere ki ētahi atu tāone iti i te riu, he mōrearea hoki, nā ngā awa nunui, nā ngā awa iti hoki he uaua ki te whakawhiti, me ngā huarahi kōkau noa. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I matapaetia te whakarewanga o tētahi niupepa tekau mā waru marama i mua atu. I whakapuakina i te Evening Post i te 4 Ākuhata 1865 tērā e whakaputaina tētahi niupepa ā-wiki hou, ka kīa ko te Wairarapa Mercury, ‘e whakatairanga ana i ngā pānga ā-rohe o Wairarapa, kia wātea i ngā wehenga ā-rangatiratanga tangata, ā-rōpū tōrangapū hoki' i raro i te whakahaere a R Wakelin’. E whā rā i muri mai ka tāpiritia e te Wellington Independent āna whakaaaro mō Richard Wakelin: ‘....nā runga i ngā pūmanawa o te ētita, e mōhiotia nuitia nei, me tāna mahi roa mō te ao Perehi, e mea ana mātou tērā tonu te hoa niupepa nei e puta ai hei manu mōhio, hei manu whai mana ki te titiro a ōna kaipānui...’ I mōhiotia a Wakelin ko 'te matua o ngā kaikawe i te rongo ki Aotearoa.' I mahi a Wakelin hei ētita mō te Wellington Independent i waenga i ngā tau 1852-1859. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko te tukunga iho, he roa tonu te kukunetanga o te niupepa, ā, nō te Hātarei tuatahi o Hānuere 1867, kātahi anō te niupepa ka puta mai. I tīmataria taua pepa e Edward rāua ko Charles Grigg. He kaimahi a Charles i mua nā te Wellington Independent. I āwhina a Wakelin i te taha etita taea noatia te marama o Nōema. I te tīmatatanga o 1868 ka tīmataria e ia te nīupepa Wairarapa Journal e rua putanga i te wiki, ā, nō te rarunga i te taha arumoni o taua niupepa, ka hurihia hei niupepa hou, ko te ingoa ko teWellington Journal. I whakaputaina taua niupepa i te tāone matua o Pōneke, kāti, ka mutu hoki tērā i te roanga atu o te tau. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He maha ngā ahi whakararu i ngā whare o te Wairarapa Mercury pēnei i te tini o ngā niupepa tuatahi. I muri i te ahi tuarua, i te 19 Nōema 1868, i taea e Archibald Arnot te hoko mai i a Richard Wakelin te mīhini double demy Albion i tāia ai te Wellington Journal i mua, me te kawe haere tonu i te whakaputanga i te niupepa, i muri i te ngaromanga mō te kotahi marama noa iho. Kua eke a Arnot hei rangatira anake, hei etita hoki mō te niupepa. I haere tonu te niupepa taea noatia ngā marama tuatahi o Ākuhata 1872, kātahi ka hāmenetia a Arnot kia whakawākia e te Kōti mō te whānako moni. I hokona e ia te pepa ki a Hirschberg ā, e ai ki ngā pūrongo, i whakamomori a Arnot i taua marama anō. Tere tonu te hoko a Hirschberg i te niupepa ki a Richard Wakelin, ka eke anō a Wakelin hei kaipupuru takitahi, hei etita hoki, ā, ka whakaputaina e ia te putanga tuatahi o te niupepa ingoa hou ā-wiki, o te Wairarapa Standard i 19 Ākuhata. I puta te kupu tāunu a te Wellington Independent : ‘te āhua nei kei runga noa atu tāna e whai nei i tā tōna tuakana o mua ake i a ia’. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ētahi marama i muri mai ka tūhono mai te hunaonga a Wakelin, a Joseph Payton, ki a ia mō te ono tau. He kura māhita a Payton, ā, i muri i te ono tau ka tahuri ia ki te whakarewa i te Wairarapa Daily i Māhitāone. Nā ngā āwhina a ētahi, ka whakahaeretia tonutia e Wakelin te Standard, i ētahi wā e toru rawa ngā putanga i te wiki. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I tōna matenga i te tau 1881 ka tuhia e te Wanganui Herald āna kupu whakamihi, inā rā ‘he whakaaro ngāwari i te taha tōrangapū, tētahi o ngā tino kaikōkiri mātāmua i ngā tikanga tautika mō te whakahaere whenua, pono hoki ..... he kaitautoko matatau hoki i a Tā George Grey, he tangata i tino tautokona e ia mō ana kaupapa here katoa i ngā rā tuatahi o ngā kāwanatanga ....’. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I muri mai ko tētahi o ngā rangatira o te Wairarapa Standard ko William C Nation me tētahi o ana tuākana tēina, kātahi ka tahuri mai a William F Roydhouse ki te hoko i te niupepa i te tau 1893. Ko ētahi o ngā kaipupuri o muri mai ko ngā tuākana tēina Nicol ā, i muri ko Thomas McCracken. I muri i tētahi atu ahi kino i te tau 1937, ka tāia te Standard i Māhitāone, ā, ka ora tonu hei niupepa e toru putanga i te wiki, me ētahi atu huringa rangatira taea noatia te tau 1942. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

The newspaper was published in Napier, where he was the Provincial Superintendent, and issues were delayed in being published due to the editor&amp;#39;s absence in connection with Maori land purchases (McLean was also the Chief Land Purchase Commissioner for the Crown).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newspaper&amp;#39;s name encapsulates the intention of the publication: &amp;lsquo;Me Hoturoa o mua i to i tona waka, a Tainui, ki te wai i Hawaiki kia rere noa i te moana tauhou ki te rapu kainga mona i nga whenua ngaro, koia hoki matou ka kokiri i ta matou waka tiwai, Te WAKA MAORI O AHURIRI nei, ki runga ki te moana ngarungaru, i te moana tarewarewa noa, o te Whakaaro tangata - mana e rewa, mana e totohu (13 June 1863: 1) (Just as Hoturoa of former times, who dragged his canoe Tainui to the water in Hawaiki and set sail over unchartered oceans in search of a home in unknown lands, so we too, launch our canoe, Te WAKA MAORI O AHURIRI, onto the choppy seas, the turbulent sea, of people&amp;#39;s thoughts - for it to float or sink).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following statement further elaborates that aim: &amp;lsquo;Tetahi painga o te Nupepa penei, hei hono mo te Pakeha raua ko te Maori. He whakaputanga whakaaro ma tatou, tetahi ki tetahi....Inaianei e noho kuare noa ana te nuinga o te Pakeha ki nga whakaaro Maori, me te Maori hoki e noho kuare noa ana ki nga whakaaro o te Pakeha. Ka whai huarahi hei whakapuakanga i o tatou whakaaro, tetahi ki te reo o tetahi, katahi ia ka tupu he rongo pai kia tatou&amp;rsquo; (ibid.) (One of the benefits of a newspaper like this will be to repair the rift between Pakeha and Maori. It will express our thoughts to each other....Nowadays the majority of Pakeha are quite ignorant of Maori views, and the Maori too are quite ignorant of Pakeha views. It will be the means by which our views are aired, one to the other, then goodwill will grow between us).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last issue was published under the title Te Waka Maori o Ahuriri on 27 July 1871. In October 1871 control of the newspaper passed entirely into the hands of government, and it became Te Waka o Niu Tirani (1871&amp;ndash;1877).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This paper was edited in Wellington by James Grindell. It was written solely in Maori until 15 October, 1873, at which time an English translation was added, column for column. Like its predecessor, this Te Waka Maori presents the government&amp;#39;s view. Much of the material published is from &amp;lsquo;kupapa&amp;rsquo; (Queen&amp;#39;s or neutral) tribes such as Ngati Porou.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1877 there was a change of government. Sir Donald McLean&amp;#39;s policy for Maori people and their land, as presented in the pages of Te Waka Maori o Ahuriri and Te Waka Maori o Niu Tirani, had been roundly criticised by the Hawke&amp;#39;s Bay Repudiation (of land sales) Movement. Several leaders of this movement were prominent in the new Liberal Government. Much of the attack on policy had been waged through the pages of the then opposition paper, Te Wananga.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The war of words between Te Wananga and Te Waka Maori continued until a group of Hawke&amp;#39;s Bay people associated with Te Wananga took Te Waka Maori to court:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Na Henare Rata raua ko Te Hiana me Karaitiana Takamoana ratou ko Te Hapuku, Tareha te Moananui, Renata Kawepo, me etahi atu rangatira Maori i whakawa Te Waka Maori i roto i te Kooti Hupirimi,a i mate taua nupepa ki reira. Nui atu to ratou hari me te koa i te hinganga o to ratou hoa riri&amp;rsquo; (Aotearoa, 4 June 1892: 1)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Henry Rata and Sheehan together with Karaitiana Takamoana, Te Hapuku, Tareha Te Moananui, Renata Kawepo, and other Maori chiefs took Te Waka Maori to the Supreme Court, from which time it ceased publication. They were greatly pleased at the downfall of their enemy.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supporters of McLean&amp;#39;s party and his policy resurrected Te Waka Maori in Gisborne. &amp;nbsp;This Te Waka Maori (1878&amp;ndash;1879) was also edited by James Grindell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The opening editorial demonstrates the link with the former Waka:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lsquo;He kupu ako pono aku tika tonu nga kupu i kitea e nga Maori i roto i nga wharangi o te Waka tawhito, a kei te Waka hou nei ka kitea ano te pono me te tika i roto i nga takiwa katoa e takoto ake nei.

When he contracted typhoid fever, the first numbered issue, which was the second published, was delayed in being printed as it was difficult to find another editor.

      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Wanganui was the first town in the wider Wellington region to have its own newspaper, the Wanganui Record, which was published for a few weeks in 1853. The Wanganui Chronicle began publication on 18 September 1856 and came out tri-weekly in 1867. Under competitive pressure it became a daily in 1871. The Chronicle continues today as Wanganui's only daily newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

Ko te Wanganui Chronicle ka tīmata i te 18 o Mahuru i te tau 1856, ā, ka puta mai i ngā wā e toru i te wiki. Nō te kaha o te puta mai o ētahi ake nūpepa, ka tīmata te puta mai o te Wanganui Chronicle ia rā i te tau 1871.

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Wanganui was the first town in the wider Wellington region to have its own newspaper, the Wanganui Record which was published for a few weeks in 1853.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Wanganui Chronicle was the next newspaper attempted in Wanganui. Henry Stokes first proposed the paper in 1856 but initially publication was held back by lack of equipment. The first issue was produced on 18 September 1856 on a makeshift press, made by staff and pupils at the local industrial school. Shortly after this Stokes imported a press from Sydney.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However in the 1860s the paper had competition from the Wanganui Times and the Evening Herald (later called the Wanganui Herald). The Times didn't survive the decade but the Herald, under John Ballance, established itself as a serious rival to the Chronicle. The Chronicle responded by publishing three times a week in 1867 (publication frequency had been erratic up till then) and then daily in 1871.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two papers competed against each other strongly for the next 100 years or more. The Chronicle tended to represent conservative opinion while the Herald was more liberal. However, the rivalry was often friendly. In 1888 Ballance let the Chronicle use his equipment to produce their paper after the Chronicle office burnt down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many 19th century New Zealand newspapers, the Chronicle changed hands a number of times. One of the most noteworthy owners and editors was Gilbert Carson who took over in 1875. Carson was Mayor of Wanganui from 1881 to 1884 and a member of the House of Representatives and the Legislative Council. He proved to be an effective opponent of John Ballance and the Wanganui Herald.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 1970s the ownership and the editorship of the Chronicle and the Herald merged and the two papers continued to come out separately (the Chronicle in the morning and the Herald in the evening). While it may have been intended to keep the papers distinct, in reality they became like two editions of the same paper. In 1986 the Herald was replaced with a community newspaper of the same name and the Chronicle continued on as Wanganui's daily newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Ko taua nūpepa ko te Wanganui Record, ā, he rite tonu te puta mai mō ētahi wiki noa iho i te tau 1853.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko te Wanganui Chronicle te nūpepa tuarua i puta mai i Wanganui I marohitia e Henry Stokes i te tau 1856. I te tīmatanga i uaua te mahi whakatā nō te mea kāhore he mīhini perehi. Ko te tānga tuatahi ka whakaputaina ki runga i tētahi mīhini perehi whakakapi i te 18 o Mahuru 1856. Nā ngā kaiako me ngā tauira o te kura hangarau pātata i hanga. I muri tata i tēnei nā, ka hokona mai e Stokes tētahi mīhini perehi mai i Poihākena (Sydney).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Engari, i te tekau tau mai i 1860, ka tīmata mai te nūpepa ko te Wanganui Times me te Evening Herald (ka karangahia ā muri ake ko te Wanganui Herald). Kāhore te Wanganui Times i tū mō te tekau tau ki muri. Engari ka tino ora te Herald i raro i Te Paranihi (John Ballance), ā, ka tipu ake he tino nūpepa kaha ki te tū i te taha o te Chronicle. I tēnei nā, ka tīmata te Chronicle ki te puta mai i ngā rā e toru i ia wiki, ā, i te tau 1871 ka puta mai ia rā. Mō ngā tau ki mua i taua rā, he kōtītiti nei te āhua o te puta mai o te nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mō te rau tau i muri mai ka rite tonu te whakataetae o ngā nūpepa nei. Ko te Chronicle ka whai i ngā kaupapa whakatūpato. Ko te Herald, ka whai ake i ngā kaupapa atawhai. Ahakoa ngā taukumekume, he whakataetae ratarata nei. I te tau 1888, ka tukuna e Te Paranihi kia tāngia te Chronicle i runga ake i āna mīhini nō te mea i tahuna tā rātou tari ki te ahi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I runga i ngā āhuatanga o ngā nūpepa o Aotearoa i tērā rau tau, ka rite tonu te whakawhiti i ngā kaipupuri o te Chronicle. Ko tētahi o ngā rangatira, ētita tino rongonui ko Gilbert Carson, ā, i uru mai ia i te tau 1875. Ko ia te Mea o te tāone o Wanganui mai i te tau 1881 ki te 1884, ā, ko ia hoki he mema mo te Whare Pāremata me te Kaunihera Ture. He tino kaitohetohe ia mō Te Paranihi me te Wanganui Herald.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I te tekau tau mai i 1970 ka tūhono ngā nūpepa e rua i raro i te rōpū kaipupuri, ētita kotahi, engari ka rite tonu te puta wehe mai (ko te Chronicle i te ata, ā, ko te Herald i te ahiahi). Ko te wawata kia noho wehe ngā nūpepa e rua nei, engari koa ka puta rāua i runga i te āhuatanga he ōrite ai ngā kōrero o tētahi ki tētahi. I te tau 1986 ka uru kē mai he nūpepa hapori e mau ana i te ingoa o te Herald. Engari ko te Chronicle kei te noho tonu ko te nūpepa o ia rā anake kei Wanganui.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The cost of the new paper was raised to 3 shillings per annum, from two shillings. For this subscribers would received a much larger paper. The Rev. Canon Tuke requested that ‘…all who owe anything for last year’s magazine will promptly remit it to the Vicar, who is considerably out of pocket in his attempt to give the Parish a good Church Paper.’ In fact, only personal financial support from the Bishop of Waiapu, Alfred Averill, ensured its early survival. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Not surprisingly, there was a break in publication for several months after the 3 February 1931 earthquake. The 1 May 1931 issue begins with a letter from the Bishop, outlining the impact of the earthquake on Diocesan property, including the complete destruction of the Cathedral. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The article ‘Synod scuttles ‘Gazette’’ in the issue of 1 November 1945 announced the impending end to publication of the Waiapu Church Gazette. The Gazette was to be amalgamated with the Church and People from Wellington and the Gazette from Auckland. This decision did not meet with the agreement of the author. This was made even clearer in the following and final issue of the Waiapu Church Gazette, 1 December 1945. Particular objection was expressed to the new focus on advertising and making a profit. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

The paper prospered on the back of the gold boom and rival newspapers were established in opposition. In 1917 the West Coast Times was absorbed into the Hokitika Guardian and Star, which ceased publication in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The West Coast Times owes its existence to the gold rush on the West Coast in 1865. Before the gold rush there were few European settlers on the West Coast, certainly not enough to sustain a newspaper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The West Coast Times was the first of many papers to start up in the Hokitika area after the rush began. The Times started in May 1865, only two months after the Provincial Government in Canterbury had proclaimed the goldfield on the West Coast. The paper was founded by John Tyrrell but soon sold to William Shaw, a local politician. Shaw was Mayor of Hokitika in 1867.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That the Times prospered on the back of the gold boom can be seen by its publishing activities. In 1865 a weekly edition for rural readers called the Leader was issued, in January 1866 the Times became a daily, and later that year they published a daily evening paper, the Despatch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boom in Hokitika and opposition to Shaw’s political activities encouraged others to set up newspapers in the town. The Times’ most serious rival was the Evening Star, founded by Joseph Klein and James Snyder Browne in 1867 mostly to oppose Shaw. The competition between these papers peaked in 1868 when Klein and Browne provided the financial backing and management for a new morning paper, the Westland Observer. Shaw responded by reviving the Despatch, his evening paper that had gone into abeyance the year before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However the situation was soon resolved when Shaw decided to leave Hokitika. Klein and Browne bought the Times from him and immediately stopped publishing the Despatch and the Observer. From then to its demise in 1917 the Times’ history was much less eventful. Ownership changed several more times. In 1874 Robert Caldwell Reid took over. Reid was a prominent politician active in both provincial and national government. In the 1880s the paper was sold to Leonard Northcroft and Harry Snow and in 1917 it was sold to Dawes, Nightingale and Co. Later that year it was absorbed into the Hokitika Guardian and Star.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

I mua o te rerenga kōura he ruarua noa iho ngā tāngata whai Pākehā i te Tai Poutini, he iti rawa hei ukauka i tētahi nūpepa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ko te West Coast Times te tuatahi o ngā nūpepa maha ki te tīmata i te takiwā o Hokitika i muri o te tīmatanga o te rerenga ki te kōura. I tīmata te West Coast Times i te marama o Haratua 1865, e rua marama noa i muri o te pānuitanga o te pārae kōura i te Tai Poutini i a te Kāwanatanga Porowini i ngā Pākihi-whakatekateka-a-Waitaha. I whakaūhia te nūpepa e John Tyrell, otirā taro tonu te hokonga ki a William Shaw, he kaitōrangapū o te rohe.

I te tau 1865 ka puta tētahi tānga ā-wiki i huaina te Leader mō te hunga taiwhenua. Ka tīmata te tānga ia rā o te Times i te marama o Kohi-tātea 1866, ā, nō muri mai i taua tau anō ka perēhitia e rātou tētahi nūpepa ā-ahiahi ia rā, arā, te Despatch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nā te tōnuitanga i Hokitika me te mautohenga ki ngā mahi tōrangapū a Shaw i whakahau i ētahi atu kia whakaūhia he nūpepa i te tāone. Ko te Evening Star te tino tāwhai o te Times, nā Joseph Klein rāua ko James Snyder Browne i whakaū i te tau 1867, he mautohe ki a Shaw te tino take. I tae rawa te whakataetae i waenganui i ngā nūpepa ki tōna tihi i te tau 1868, i te whakaratonga o Klein rāua ko Browne i te pūtea tautoko, i te whakahaerenga hoki mō tētahi nūpepa ā-ata, arā, te Westland Observer. Ko te whakautu a Shaw ko te whakaoratanga i te Despatch, tana nūpepa ā-ahiahi i whakamutua i te tau i mua.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heoi i whakatau tonu tēnei āhuatanga i te whakaritenga o Shaw ki te wehe atu i Hokitika. Ka hokona i a ia te Times e Klein rāua ko Browne, ā, whakamutua wawetia ana e rāua te tānga o te Despatch me te Observer. Mai i tērā wā tae noa ki tōna mutunga i 1917 he āhua hira kore te hītori o te Times. He maha tonu ngā whakawhitinga rangatiratanga. I te tau 1874 ka taumanu a Robert Caldwell Reid. He kaitōrangapū whakarae a Reid, he mātātoa ki ngā kāwanatanga ā-rohe, ā-motu hoki. I hokona te nūpepa ki a Leonard Northcroft rāua ko Harry Snow i te tekau tau mai i 1880, ā, i te tau 1917 ka hokona ki te kamupene o Dawes, Nightingale &amp; Co. Nō muri mai i taua tau anō ka hanumi ki te Hokitika Guardian and Star.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I mutu te tānga o te Hokitika Guardian i te tau 1988. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

It was founded by Charles Augustus and Harold Wilson, two brothers aged nineteen and seventeen, who were joined a year later by their younger brother George Wilson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After six months the paper doubled in size and was issued as a weekly penny paper. By twelve months it came out three times a week to match its rival, the Waimate Times. Editorially the paper aimed to be politically independent and described itself as taking an active interest in the social affairs of Waimate and the surrounding district.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1908 the paper was taken over by S H Wilson (no relation to the original owners) with Robert Joseph Logan as editor. In 1914 it became a daily and in 1916 it was transferred to Logan and Mrs A K Sargent, who changed the name to the Waimate Daily Advertiser to reflect the earlier change in publication frequency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1921 the paper was sold to the Waimate Advertiser Company, although Mrs Sargent retained the majority interest. The change in ownership again brought about a name change and the paper became the Daily Advertiser. In 1922 the company purchased the rival Waimate Times, leaving the Daily Advertiser as the town's sole newspaper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Waimate Publishing Company took over the business in 1939. In 1972 the paper changed back to its former title of Waimate Daily Advertiser, and from 1980 reverted to its original title of Waimate Advertiser. This last change coincided with a change back to being published three times a week. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Joseph Payton, a school teacher, was a partner with his father-in-law Richard Wakelin in one of them, the bi-weekly Wairarapa Standard which began publication in 1872. However, when Payton decided Masterton was destined to be the largest town in the valley, he convened a meeting in the more northerly town to discuss beginning a newspaper there. There were several short-lived attempts from the end of 1874, not helped by the premises of two papers being burned to the ground. Subsequently, Joseph Payton, now in partnership with W F Roydhouse and Edward Samuel began, in November 1878, the region’s first daily, the Wairarapa Daily. It absorbed one of the town’s struggling papers. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Initially, Payton was editor, sub-editor and business manager on the four-page evening paper, Roydhouse was general reporter and Samuel supplied articles on a more casual basis. Edward Samuel retired from the enterprise when he was appointed headmaster of the Carterton School in 1880, leaving Messrs Payton and Roydhouse as partners. By 1878 the railway had reached only as far as Featherston, so for the next two years William Roydhouse spent considerable time in the saddle covering events in the lower valley. The railway reached Masterton in 1880, simplifying distribution, previously by relays of horses, and the town grew as Payton had foreseen. The 1878 population of 1,673 had nearly doubled to 3,160 by 1886. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first printing machine consisted of a large non-stop drum, with one employee feeding in the paper at the top and a boy at the back taking off the printed sheets which were then folded by hand. The power was generated by a flywheel turned by two more boys. About 1903, an Elliott printing press was installed, first driven by a gas engine and later converted to electricity. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1892, the paper, now well-established, changed its name to the Wairarapa Daily Times. There was evening competition from the Wairarapa Star for a number of years, one of its editors being Alexander W Hogg, later MP for Masterton and a cabinet minister in 1909. Following changes in ownership, the Star was reborn as a morning daily, the Wairarapa Age, in 1902. Later editors included A H Vile and Guy H Scholefield, who became Parliamentary Librarian in 1926. &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Joseph Payton, who kept plant and type up-to-date, ran one of the country’s best produced provincial newspapers until his death in 1910. It also had a reputation for the quality and depth of its local coverage. A private Payton family company then ran the Wairarapa Daily Times until it merged with the Wairarapa Times-Age in 1938. In 2002 the newspaper was bought by Wilson &amp; Horton which was subsequently acquired by APN News &amp; Media. &lt;p&gt;</Essay>

Near the mouth of the Buller River, and on its eastern bank, Westport’s early growth was principally due to the gold rush at Charlestown, 26 kms to the south. From 1866 to the end of the decade, the population in and around Charleston ballooned to about 10,000. At the peak of this gold rush in 1867, Westport’s population was about 1,500 but growth over subsequent decades was slow and sporadic.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

From 1866 to the end of the decade, the population in and around Charleston ballooned to about 10,000. At the peak of this gold rush in 1867, Westport’s population was about 1,500 but growth over subsequent decades was slow and sporadic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first Westport newspaper was quickly on the scene. John Tyrrell, who learnt the printing trade in Dublin, arrived in New Zealand via Australia and a stint with the Melbourne Chronicle, Australia’s first, if short-lived, evening paper. He started the West Coast Times in Hokitika in 1865, launched the daily Waimea Chronicle in early 1866, and then the Westport Times in December that year. He began it as the Westport Times and Buller Express in partnership with Job Munson, an American-born printer, who began in the trade as a 11-year-old. Munson sold his holding several years before becoming a shareholder in the rival Westport News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With Charleston booming, in 1867 the paper’s plant was moved there briefly and, also temporarily, its name changed to Westport Times and Charleston Argus. The name was shortened to Westport Times in 1869. It usually appeared twice weekly but, according to the Union List of NZ Newspapers Before 1940, there may have been periods when it came out three times a week or even daily. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 1871, Irishman Eugene O’Connor, later a prominent South Island politician, briefly owned the paper before setting up the rival Westport News. Tyrrell, owner again, countered by producing the Westport Times as a daily for a period. In the early 1880s Tyrrell bought the Westport Evening Star, which had begun in 1867. In 1883, he was found guilty of libelling Charles Wright, in an ‘Open Column’ letter in the Star in relation to his conduct as borough valuer. Wright was also proprietor of the Buller News. Tyrrell was fined £50. In 1892, when Tyrrell died, the two papers merged to become the Westport Times and Evening Star. Later, probably in 1898, the then-daily became the Westport Times and Star. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Following John Tyrrell’s death, Thomas Patrick Williams became the managing proprietor. Born in Auckland, he joined the staff of the Westport Times as printer’s devil in 1872 and had become manager by 1885. The Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Nelson, Marlborough and Westland Provincial Districts), published in 1906, listed William Gothard as editor. An Australian, he had been apprenticed to Tyrrell in 1874, having worked in the Post Office previously and then ‘served through all branches of the newspaper and printing business’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The newspaper continued as a daily until 1937 and a change of ownership and name. A new private company in Hokitika, with a capital of £300 in £1 shares, took over the Westport Times and Star and called it the Buller Times. It ceased publication on November 1, 1941. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The Wanganui Herald (originally the Evening Herald) was first published by John Ballance as a daily newspaper on 4 June 1867. Ballance was prominent in local and national politics. He was leader of the first Liberal government and premier of New Zealand from 1891 until he died in 1893. The paper continued to be published until 1986 when a community newspaper with the same name replaced it.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;John Ballance established the Wanganui Herald in 1867. He was prominent in local and national politics and was leader of the first Liberal government and premier of New Zealand from 1891 until he died in 1893.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballance arrived in Wanganui in 1865 where he set up a shop. He was soon drawn into journalism through his interest in local issues. He wrote occasionally for the Wanganui Times, which at that time was the rival of the established newspaper the Wanganui Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1867 Ballance bought a press and started a daily newspaper called the Evening Herald, using the paper to express his strong political opinions. He was a member of the Wanganui cavalry troop but was particularly critical of the way military campaigns were conducted against the Māori in the Wanganui area. For this he was arrested and threatened with court martial. Ballance also used the Herald to attack the Chronicle who responded equally strongly. This spirited competition continued until the papers merged in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite losing money in its early years, the Wanganui Herald established itself as a viable concern. Between 1869 and 1906 it also published the Weekly Herald (later called the Yeoman). From 1926 it published a children's newspaper as an insert, which was a first for a New Zealand newspaper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1971 the ownership of the Herald and the Chronicle merged. Wanganui, like other New Zealand towns and cities, was unable to sustain two daily newspapers although it managed this for longer than most other places in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Herald was replaced in 1986 by a community newspaper with the same name leaving its great rival, the Chronicle, to continue as Wanganui's only daily newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Nō muri tata mai i kitea he rongoā mō tēnei raruraru hua kore.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Gold was first discovered at Waihi, to the south of the Coromandel Peninsula, in 1878. In 1882 the first battery was breaking gold-bearing rock at the Martha Mine which was later one of the world’s most significant gold and silver mines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; By the mid-1890s, Waihi had a sufficiently settled population to encourage Messrs Galbraith and Vercker-Bindon to start a bi-weekly, the Waihi Miner and Hauraki Goldfields Gazette. The Waihi Chronicle, part-owned by William Wallnutt, later long-time Waihi mayor, sharebroker and contributor to other papers, became a daily competitor in 1900, forcing the Waihi Miner to follow suit. The unprofitable impasse was soon to be resolved. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is likely that William Geddis, co-owner of Auckland’s New Zealand Observer, with William Blomfield, was interested in Waihi because he was chairman of directors of the Rising Sun Gold Mining Company which operated a mine at Owharoa between Paeroa and Waihi. In the event, with some financial assistance from the Auckland Star’s Henry Brett, Geddis purchased the Waihi Miner. In 1901, the Geddis-Blomfield partnership renamed the paper the Waihi Daily Telegraph. The last issue of the Waihi Chronicle was on 1 March 1901; the first issue of the Waihi Daily Telegraph, billed as an up-to-date, one penny evening daily, appeared three days later. It printed a wide range of overseas cables as well as local news and was a steadfast supporter of the mining industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One typical editorial, in March 1905, was highly critical of the Hon James McGowan, Minister of Mines, who had made his portfolio ‘.... a comfortable means to a comfortable end’ and ‘has displayed parsimony towards the industry that he ought to have fostered, but it is reassuring to learn on such high authority [Prime Minister Seddon] that the era of parsimony is at an end, and that the goldfields industry is to receive the encouragement that its importance warrants ....’ &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite his Auckland newspaper interests, Geddis settled in Waihi for a number of years. As well as securing the newspaper’s future, Geddis was elected to the first Waihi Borough Council in 1902. He left Waihi in 1908 to edit and manage the Napier Daily Telegraph, bought in partnership with Henry Brett and T W Leys. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Waihi Daily Telegraph was subsequently run by Nisbet McRobie, formerly manager of the New Zealand Times in Wellington and later president of the Auckland Master Printers Association. At this time Waihi had three times the population of Hamilton and was the Auckland province’s fastest-growing town. There was competition from the Waihi Times for a period from 1906, but more serious economically to both the town and newspaper was the 1912 miners’ strike. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When McRobie left in 1915, the Waihi Daily Telegraph reverted to Geddis and Blomfield for a period. From 1919, W H Toy, previously on the literary staff of the New Zealand Herald, became owner and editor. Like William Geddis, he served on the Waihi Borough Council. From the 1920s the newspaper was published two or three times a week. After Toy’s death in 1936, his son, W A Toy, ran the paper until 1951. Then a weekly, it stopped publication shortly after the Waihi Gazette set up in opposition. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt; I kitea tuatahitia te kōura i Waihi, i te pito tonga o te Tara o te Ika a Māui, i te tau 1878. Nō te tau 1882 ka tīmata te kuru tuatahi hei wāwāhi i ngā toka pupuru kōura i te keringa o Martha, ka huri i roto i te wā hei keringa hira rawa atu i te ao katoa mō te kōura me te hiriwa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te taenga ki waenga i ngā tau 1890-1900, he maha tonu te taupori āta noho i Waihi, koia i huri ai a Galbraith rāua ko Vercker-Bindon ki te tīmata i te niupepa rua putanga i te wiki, ko te ingoa ko te Waihi Miner and Hauraki Goldfields Gazette. Ka whai i muri ko te Waihi Chronicle, ā, ka eke hei tino hoa tauwhāinga ia rā i te tau 1900, i huri ai te Waihi Miner kia pērā anō ana putanga. Ko te rangatira o tētahi wāhi o ngā hea o taua niupepa o te Chronicle ko William Wallnutt, he koromatua nō te tāone o Waihi mō te wā roa, he kaipupuru hea, he kaiāwhina hoki i ētahi atu pepa. Nō muri tata mai i kitea he rongoā mō tēnei raruraru hua kore. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ko te take i huri ai a William Geddis tētahi kaipupuru ngātahi o te New Zealand Observer, i Tāmaki-makau-rau, me tana hoa a William Blomfield. Te āhua nei ko te take i huri ai a Geddis ki te whaiwhai i ngā āhuatanga o Waihi nā te mea koia te heamana kaitohutohu o te Rising Sun Gold Mining Company nāna i whakahaere tētahi keringa i Owharoa i waenga i Paeroa meWaihi. I te tukunga iho, ka hokona e Geddis te Waihi Miner, ko Henry Brett o te Auckland Star te kaiāwhina mō te taha moni. Nō te tau 1901, nā te tokorua nei nā Geddis-Blomfield i whakaingoa te niupepa ko te Waihi Daily Telegraph. Ko te putanga whakamutunga o te Waihi Chronicle i te 1 March 1901; ā, e toru rā i muri mai ka hokona te putanga tuatahi o te Waihi Daily Telegraph, i kīa e ōna rangatira he niupepa whai pūrongo mohoa, he niupepa mō ia rā, kotahi kapa te utu. Ka tāngia e te pepa te huhuatanga o ngā waea mai i tāwāhi, tae atu ki ngā pūrongo o te wā kāinga, ā, he tino kaitautoko ia mō te ahumahi keri whenua. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ka whakaputaina e ia tētahi tuhinga etita i te marama o Poutūterangi 1905, i ātete atu ki te Honore James McGowan, te Minita mō ngā Keringa, e mōhio ana tātou ko tāna mahi matua i tana tūnga 'he whaiwhai noa iho i te moni kia rangatira ai tana noho', ā, 'i matapiko rā ki te ahumahi e tika ana kia taurimatia e ia. Engari he pai ki te rongo i ngā kupu a te tino tohunga [a Te Pirimia a Seddon] kua mutu ngā wā o te matapiko, kua huri ia ki te atawhai me te tiaki i te ahumahi keringa, kia eke ai ki tōna tūnga teitei, kia rite ki tōna hiranga...' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ahakoa ana hea i ngā niupepa o Tāmaki-makau-rau, ka noho a Geddis ki Waihi mō ētahi tau. I tua atu i te whakaū i te noho o te niupepa, ka pōtitia a Geddis ki te Kaunihera tuatahi o te rohe o Waihi i te tau 1902. Ka wehe atu i Waihi i te tau 1908 ki te whakatika ki te whakahaere hoki i te Daily Telegraph o Ahuriri, he mea hoko ngātahi me Henry Brett rāua ko T W Leys. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō muri mai ka whakahaeretia te Waihi Daily Telegraph e Nisbet McRobie, koia te kaiwhakahaere o mua o te New Zealand Times i Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara, koia hoki te tumuaki o te Auckland Master Printers Association. I taua wā e toru ngā tāngata o te taupori o Waihi ki te tangata kotahi o te taupori o Kirikiriroa, koia hoki te tāone tere rawa te tupu o te takiwā o Tāmaki-makau-rau. I noho anō te Waihi Times hei hoa tauwhāinga mō te wā mai i 1906, engari ko te tino raruraru nui i pā ki te tāone me te niupepa i te taha ōhanga ko te tū-te-ihu a ngā kaikeri o te tau 1912.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nō te wehenga atu o McRobie i te tau 1915, ka hoki te Waihi Daily Telegraph ki a Geddis rāua ko Blomfield mō tētahi wā. Mai i 1919, ka noho a W H Toy hei rangatira, hei etita hoki. He kaimahi ia i te taha tuhituhi o te New Zealand Herald i mua. He rite tonu ki a William Geddis, arā, ka uru ia ki te Kaunihera o te rohe o Waihi. Mai i ngā tau mai i 1920 e rua, e toru rānei ngā putanga o te niupepa i te wiki. I muri i te matenga o Toy i te tau 1936, ka huri tana tama a W A Toy ki te whakahaere i te pepa taea noatia te tau 1951. He niupepa ā-wiki ia i taua wā, ā, ka mutu tana puta ki ao i muri tata tonu iho i te whakatūnga o te Waihi Gazette hei hoa tauwhāinga. &lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Description language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The first issue of the Wellington Independent was published on 2 April 1845. For a time it was considered one of the best newspapers in New Zealand and it had considerable influence. However, it failed to grow in the 1860s and early 1870s and, despite changing from bi-weekly to tri-weekly publication, was replaced by the New Zealand Times in 1874.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
      <Description language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;I whakaputaina te putanga tuatahi o te Wellington Independent i te 2 o Paenga-whāwhā 1845. Mō tētahi wā i kīia ko tētahi o ngā tino nūpepa o Aotearoa, ā, ka nui anō tōna whai mana. ēngari, kīhai i tino pakari ake i te tekau tau mai i 1860 me ngā tau tīmatanga o te tekau tau mai i 1870, ā, ahakoa atu te huringa kia whakaputaina i ngā rā e toru ki te wiki mai i ngā rā e rua katahi ka tū kē mai ko te New Zealand Times i te tau 1874.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;The history of the Wellington Independent is interwoven with that of other early newspapers in the Capital, particularly the New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian (1844-1865) and the New Zealand Gazette and Britannia Spectator (1839-1844).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Spectator began in Wellington in 1844 immediately after the demise of the Gazette (which was New Zealand's first newspaper). In 1845 the Spectator's owners sacked the printers of the paper after they ran a provocative advertisement. As a result the printers decided to set up a rival paper - the Wellington Independent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first issue of the Independent came out on 2 April 1845 but publication stopped four months later when the paper's equipment was sold to the Spectator to pay off its owner's debts. The owner of the equipment, Samuel Revans, had previously edited the Gazette and had also supplied the provocative advertisement to the Spectator that led to the printers being sacked. By November that year the Independent got another press and soon established itself as the more popular paper. It went on to outlive the Spectator by nine years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Independent was more popular because it advocated for representative government against the Spectator, which supported Governor George Grey's preference for continuing with colonial rule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to GH Scholefield (Newspapers in New Zealand, 1958) the Independent was one of the best newspapers in New Zealand. It had considerable influence, which can be seen from the contributors who included James Edward Wakefield, William Fox, Edward Stafford and Dillon Bell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper failed to expand in the 1860s and 1870s but was still a going concern when it was replaced by the New Zealand Times in 1874. In 1873 it was sold to Julius Vogel's New Zealand Times Company. Vogel planned to publish a national newspaper from Wellington to be used to further his political ambitions. In 1874 he replaced the Independent with his new paper the New Zealand Times which continued the serial numbering from the Independent. The Times didn't become a national paper but it did continue until 1927, when it was absorbed by the Dominion.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Kō ngā kōrero tawhito o te Wellington Independent e kī ana i ngā kōrero mai i ētahi atu o ngā nūpepa tōmua o te tāone matua pērā i te New Zealand Spectator me te Cook's Straits Guardian (1844-1865) tae atu ana te New Zealand Gazette me te Britannia Spectator (1839-1844).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tīmata te New Zealand Spectator i Pōneke i te tau 1844 i muri tonu i te ngaromanga o te Gazette (te nūpepa tuatahi o Aotearoa). I te tau 1845 ka whakamutua e ngā rangatira o te Spectator ngā kaitā o te nūpepa mō tā rātou whakaputa i tētahi pānui taki. Mai i tērā kātahi ka huri aua kaitā ki te hanga i tētahi atu nūpepa kē, ko te Wellington Independent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tāngia tuatahitia te Wellington Independent i te 2 o Paenga-whāwhā 1845, ēngari i mutu noa i ngā marama e whā i muri mai i te hokonga o ngā taputapu o taua nūpepa ki te Spectator hei utu i ngā nama a ōna rangatira. Ko te kaipupuri o aua taputapu a Samuel Revans, i tū hei ētita mō te Gazette i mua atu, ā, nāna hoki te mahi ki te whakaputa i te pānui taki ki te Spectator i whakamutua ai ngā kaitā. I Whiringa-ā-rangi o taua tau ka whiwhi te Independent i tētahi atu mīhini perehi, ā, kīhai i roa ka tū kē mai hei nūpepa i paingia e te nuinga. I tū kē mai mō ngā tau e iwa i muri mai i te mutunga o te Spectator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I piki ake ai te painga o te Independent nā tōna tautoko kia whakatūria he kāwanatanga tā te nuinga e whakatau ai me tohu kia rerekē atu ai ki tā te Spectator me tana tautoko i te kawe a Kāwana Hōri Kerei kia ū tonu ki te kāwanatanga koroni.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ki tā GH Scholefield (Newspapers in New Zealand, 1958) ko te Independent tētahi o ngā tino nūpepa o Aotearoa. Ka nui anō te whai mana meina ka tirohia ake ngā kaituku kōrero pērā i James Edward Wakefield, Te Pōkiha (William Fox), Edward Stafford me Dillon Bell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kīhai i whakawhānui ake te nūpepa nei i te tekau tau mai i 1860 me te tekau tau mai i 1870, ēngari e haere tonu ana i te wā i riro ai ia te New Zealand Times i te tau 1874.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hokona atu ki te kamupene a Julius Vogel, ko te New Zealand Times Company, i te tau 1873. Ko te whakaaro a Vogel kia hangāia he nūpepa ā-motu hei kawe i ōna ake wawata tōrangapū. I te tau 1874 ka hurihia e ia te Independent ki tana nūpepa hōu, ko te New Zealand Times, i kawea tonu hoki ngā rārangi tatau mai i te Independent. Kīhai te Times i tū hei nūpepa ā-motu ēngari i tū tae noa ki te tau 1927, arā, te tau i riro ai ki raro i te maru o te Dominion.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

      <Essay language="en" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Alexander McMinn began the Woodville Examiner in early October 1883. The Irish-born McMinn was an experienced journalist, having come to New Zealand, one of the country&amp;rsquo;s first war correspondents, to report on the Land Wars for a London newspaper. After editing the Rangitikei Advocate for several years, he launched the morning Manawatu Daily Standard, Rangitikei Advertiser, and West Coast Gazette in Palmerston North in November 1880.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever the optimist, McMinn then set to work on an ambitious plan for a regional chain of newspapers, the first being the twice-weekly Woodville Examiner, Waipawa Advertiser and East Coast Gazette. There was some suspicion in Woodville about the new paper as it was presumed it would be published in Palmerston North and not promote Woodville&amp;rsquo;s &amp;nbsp;interests. In fact, the paper was printed in Woodville and McMinn made something of this in his Manawatu Standard. &amp;lsquo;On Wednesday the first printing press that has ever been taken through the Manawatu Gorge will be despatched to its future destination &amp;ndash; Woodville &amp;ndash; for the use of the Woodville Examiner.&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After some energetic canvassing, there was a more positive attitude to the new paper. The Woodville correspondent of the Waipawa Mail wrote:&amp;nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Whatever is to keep the paper going remains a mystery, as the district can hardly furnish a paragraph once a month these quiet times. But it is a noticeable fact that those who at first ran down the affair, and everything and everyone connected with it, have now apparently thought fit to give it their countenance and support.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;It was, though, an immense physical battle for McMinn to produce the Woodville paper. Twice a week he would set out late at night on horseback with columns of type, navigating the rough, unlit Manawatu Gorge road. When he arrived in Woodville in the early hours of the morning he immediately began setting up the paper, and the next night made the difficult return trip to Palmerston North.&amp;nbsp; Although Alexander McMinn was an impressive figure of a man &amp;ndash; well over six feet tall and weighing eighteen stone &amp;ndash; the repeated effort was too much, particularly after a move to tri-weekly publication in 1880 and the Woodville paper was sold after two years, in 1885.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Examiner subsequently had several owners, and was a daily from October 1891 to early January 1893 when it reverted to three days a week. John Grant, from the Bruce Herald, owned the paper for a number of years from 1900. After his death in 1916, his daughter Mabel became manager and editor. At the time she was engaged to a Woodville farmer, but remained single to give her full attention to the paper. &amp;nbsp;In 1928 she sold the paper to A H Vile, Sonja Davies&amp;rsquo; grandfather. The paper closed in 1938.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>
      <Essay language="mi" append_statement="true" start_year="1000" end_year="2100">&lt;p&gt;Nā Alexander McMinn i whakarewa te Woodville Examiner i ngā rā tuatahi o Oketopa 1883. I whānau a McMinn i Airani, ā, ka haere mai ki Aotearoa. Koia tētahi o ngā kaikawe rongo pakanga tuatahi o tēnei whenua, he tautōhito ki ngā mahi tuhituhi rongo kōrero, ā, ka tau mau ki Aotearoa ki te tuku pūrongo mō ngā pakanga whenua, mō tētahi o ngā niupepa i Rānana. I muri i ana mahi ētita i te Rangitikei Advocate mō ētahi tau, ka whakarewaina e ia te niupepa ata o te Manawatu Daily Standard, te Rangitikei Advertiser, and West Coast Gazette i Papaioea i te marama o Nōema 1880.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He tangata ngākau hari a McMinn nā reira pea i tahuri ai ki te whakatū i tētahi kupenga ā-rohe nui. Ko te tuatahi ko te niupepa rua putanga i te wiki e mōhiotia nei te Woodville Examiner, Waipawa Advertiser and East Coast Gazette. Tērā ētahi i ngākau-rua i roto i Woodville nā te mea i whakaarotia tērā pea e whakaputaina i Papaioea, e kore ai ia e hāpai i ngā āhuatanga o Woodville.

E rua ana haerenga i te wiki me ana tīwae poraka tā, mā runga hōiho, arā, ki te whai i te huarahi tūpoupou, kore māramatanga hoki o te Āpiti, arā, te Manawatū Gorge.

The paper was first published in Ngaruawahia but moved to Hamilton in 1875. At this time Jones sold out of the paper (now the Waikato Times) and the Bank of New Zealand and Auckland lawyer Frederick Whitaker bought a controlling influence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From 1878 George Edgecumbe, local body politician and real estate agent, became the paper's business manager. In 1896 the Bank cancelled Edgecumbe's lease and sold the Times to James Shiner Bond. Edgecumbe left to start the Waikato Argus and took with him the editor, Henry Holloway, as well as the files, advertising contacts and goodwill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After initially contemplating legal action, Bond focussed on the task of rebuilding the paper, merging his Cambridge newspaper, the Waikato Advocate, with the Times. He converted it to a daily (evening) publication. The new editor was Sydney Greville Smith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Times and the Argus competed for 20 years, in business and politics, until merging in 1915. The new Waikato Times was now politically independent, but became a powerful voice for promoting the region's development. During the 1920s new linotype and then stereotype presses enabled the paper to significantly increase its the print run in order to meet an increasing circulation demand from a growing population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From 1968 to 1976 the paper was known simply as the Times. No new competitors emerged and it continues as a daily to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;</Essay>

Ko Henry Holloway tōna ētita, he tautōhito i ngā āhuatanga o ngā nūpepa o Niu Tīreni. I tā tuatahitia i Ngāruawāhia, ēngari ka nukuhia ki Kirikiriroa i te tau 1875. I taua wā ka hokona te nūpepa (i taua wā ko te ingoa ko te Waikato Times) e Jones, ka riro te mana whakahaere i te Pēke o Niu Tīreni rāua ko Frederick Whitaker, he rōia i ākarana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mai i te tau 1878, ko te kaiwhakahaere pakihi ko George Edgecumbe, he kaitōrangapū o te rohe, he kaihoko rawa whenua hoki. I te tau 1896 ka whakakorea te rīhi a Edgecumbe e te Pēke, ka hokona ai ki a James Shiner Bond. Ka wehe atu a Edgecumbe me te ētita, a Henry Holloway, ngā kōnae kōrero, ngā kirimana pānuitanga, me te kaingākaunui a te iwi, kia whakatū tētahi nūpepa kē, arā, te Waikato Argus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ka mutu te whakaaro ki te hāmene, ka whakapau a Bond i ōna kaha ki te whakahou i te nūpepa, me te hono i te Times ki tāna nūpepa i Horotiu (Cambridge), ko te Waikato Advocate.
